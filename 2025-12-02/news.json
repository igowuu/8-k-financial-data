We're committed to investing in Eventbrite for the long run, and hope we'll be able to help it reach new heights.\" \"Eventbrite helped unlock something profoundly human: the need to gather, to connect, and to build community around the passions we share.

This guidance is consistent with the guidance issued in the Company's press release dated November 6, 2025.

This is due to the fact that future period non-GAAP guidance includes adjustments for items not indicative of our core operations, and as a result from changes to our business due to transactions and other events. Such items may, from time to time, include loss on repayment/extinguishment of debt; gain (loss) from equity method investees, loss on option exercise, change in fair value of contingent consideration, change in tax receivable agreement liability, other income (expense), gain (loss) on disposal of non-strategic assets, right-of-use asset impairments, losses on lease terminations, repositioning costs, stock-based compensation expense, severance costs, dividends and accretion on Series A Preferred Stock and transaction-related costs.

(Nasdaq: KOYN) and First Digital Group Ltd. Announce A Letter of Intent for a Proposed Business Combination to Create a Global Stablecoin and Digital Payments Leader First Digital Group is a leading stablecoin and digital asset infrastructure provider, and the group behind FDUSD - the #3 most-traded stablecoin globally - supported by a compliance-first, fully backed trust framework and a rapidly expanding global payments and infrastructure ecosystem. YORK, NY HONG KONG SAR Dec. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) First Digital Group Ltd. (\"First Digital\" or the \"company\") and CSLM Digital Asset Acquisition Corp III, Ltd. (\"KOYN\"), a publicly listed special purpose acquisition company, jointly announce that they have entered into a non-binding letter of intent (\"LOI\") for a proposed business combination. Upon completion, the combined company is expected to be publicly listed on a national securities exchange in the United States. First Digital Group: A Global Leader in Digital Asset Infrastructure First Digital has established itself as one of the most progressive and fastest-growing innovators in digital finance, evolving from its roots in traditional trust and custody services into a global provider of institution-ready digital asset infrastructure. Founded in 2019 and restructured under Gibraltar-based First Digital Group Ltd. in 2022, the company now operates across multiple jurisdictions with a compliance-first operating model and a proven record of delivering secure, reliable, and scalable financial technology solutions. At the center of First Digital's offering is FDUSD, a USD-denominated stablecoin fully backed by cash and cash equivalents held in a Hong Kong-registered, bankruptcy-remote trust structure. FDUSD has rapidly established itself as one of the most actively traded stablecoins on centralized exchanges, reaching more than US$1 billion in market capitalization within its first four months and later surpassing a peak circulation of more than US$4.4 billion as adoption accelerated. Supported by tier-1 exchange integrations and world-class liquidity partners, FDUSD has processed more than US$2 trillion in cumulative trading volume since launch, demonstrating deep liquidity and sustained demand across global markets. Fully backed by segregated reserves held with its licensed custodian affiliate and supported by independent monthly attestations and robust AML/KYC controls, FDUSD has become a trusted and scalable digital dollar for exchanges, institutional users, and on-chain payment applications. First Digital operates a compliance-first regulated foundation with licenses, and registrations, in key financial centers. The company's rapidly expanding product ecosystem includes stablecoin-as-a-service solutions for corporates, global stablecoin payment rails with real-time settlement capabilities, on-chain and off-chain APIs for commerce, swap services, custody, minting/redemption, and merchant tools, as well as infrastructure enabling cross-border settlement, remittances, and DeFi integrations. The company currently expects to report approximately US$80-$90 million in unaudited revenue for 2025, reinforcing its position as a leading force in the transition toward the modern digital asset economy. First Digital are ready to launch Finance District - a decentralized finance ecosystem built on a foundation of institutional trust, which will mark a major milestone for First Digital. At its core is Prism, an agentic payments and settlement layer that allows autonomous AI agents and digital assistants to transact, settle, and distribute value at machine speed using FDUSD. This unlocks an entirely new category of AI-powered financeenabling businesses to automate revenue flows, streamline operational costs, and participate in a rapidly expanding on-chain economy without compromising compliance or reliability. With Finance District, First Digital is positioning itself at the forefront of the next wave of DeFi, where programmable payments, community governance, and real-world utility converge to create the financial infrastructure of the autonomous economy.

Additional information and publicly available filings regarding this matter can be found at: https://1stdigital.com/ir-and-disclosures Strategic Rationale for the Proposed Business Combination KOYN's management team has deep experience across SPAC transactions, digital assets, and structured capital markets, and believes First Digital is uniquely positioned to become a global leader in a sector benefiting from intensifying global regulatory clarity for stablecoins; explosive growth in cross-border payments, remittances, and on-chain settlement; increasing institutional demand for fully backed, compliant, transparent stablecoins; and the shift toward Web3 payments infrastructure and programmable money. The combined company aims to accelerate First Digital's international scaling, broaden its product suite, and further institutionalize its regulatory and compliance footprint. Management Commentary First Digital Founder & CEO Vincent Chok: Taking the world's first APAC-rooted and emerging-market-focused USD stablecoin issuer public is a milestone not just for First Digital, but for the evolution of digital finance globally. We have spent years building the infrastructure of trust. Transparent reserves, regulated structures, and institution-ready rails, and today marks the beginning of the next chapter. With the launch of the Finance District and our agentic payments layer, Prism, later this year we are opening the door to real-time, AI-powered settlement and a new generation of programmable commerce. This proposed combination with KOYN positions us to scale globally and continue shaping the future of trusted digital dollars.\" CSLM Digital Asset Acquisition Corp III, Ltd Chairman Vik Mittal: \"We are humbled to partner with a visionary of Vincent's standing.

Excluding a total 2025 adjustment of $0.07 per share, this forecast represents a projected increase of 13.5% to 15.1% versus adjusted diluted EPS of $6.57 in 2024.

In connection with his appointment, as discussed above in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, on December 1, 2025, the Company, First Light and Mr. Arens entered into a letter agreement. The disclosure in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02. Mr. Arens is the Chief Executive Officer, Founder and Senior Portfolio Manager of First Light, which he founded in 2013. Prior to establishing First Light, Mr. Arens was president and senior portfolio manager at Kopp Investment Advisors. While at Kopp Investment Advisors, he served as the sole portfolio manager for the firm's health care-focused investment strategy. Mr. Arens graduated from Purdue University with a bachelor of science degree in financial planning. First Light is the Company's largest stockholder and First Light and Mr. Arens collectively own approximately 13.9 million shares of common stock, or approximately 19% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock. Since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year through the present, there have been no transactions with the Company, and there are currently no proposed transactions with the Company, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which Mr. Arens had or will have a direct or indirect material interest within the meaning of Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. No arrangement or understanding exists between Mr. Arens and any other person pursuant to which Mr. Arens was selected as a director of the Company. In addition, on December 1, 2025, the Board determined that it would not renominate Matthew Kolb for election at the Company's 2026 annual meeting of stockholders and Mr. Kolb then notified the Board that he agreed he would not stand for re-election at the Company's 2026 annual meeting of stockholders. There were no disagreements between Mr. Kolb and the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices which resulted in Mr. Kolb deciding not to stand for re-election. Mr. Kolb's term will end immediately prior to the commencement of the 2026 annual meeting of stockholders. As a result, the Board approved a reduction in the size of the Board from nine (9) to eight (8) directors, which reduction will become effective immediately prior to the commencement of the Company's 2026 annual meeting of stockholders.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9983078241348267}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9973962306976318}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995111227035522}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9965559244155884}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.7114289402961731}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9901508092880249}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999629020690918}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999461829662323}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994452595710754}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992868304252625}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994959831237793}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992637038230896}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9987261891365051}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.839329719543457}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9976038336753845}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995467066764832}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9746330380439758}], "sentiment": "neutral"}, "item 7.01": {"text": "On December 2, 2025, the Company issued a press release announcing the appointment of Mr. Arens as a director and that Mr. Kolb would not stand for re-election at the Company's 2026 annual meeting of stockholders.

(Nasdaq: JSPR) (Jasper), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on development of briquilimab, a novel antibody therapy targeting KIT (CD117) to address mast cell driven diseases such as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) and asthma, reported positive preliminary clinical data from Jasper's ETESIAN Phase 1b study of subcutaneous briquilimab in adult participants with allergic asthma. A single subcutaneous 180mg dose of briquilimab demonstrated substantial reductions in sputum eosinophils at both six and twelve weeks, as well as improvements over baseline in FEV both Early Asthmatic Response (EAR) and Late Asthmatic Response (LAR). Significant reductions in serum tryptase were observed, consistent with reductions observed in other briquilimab studies at the 180mg dose level. Briquilimab was well tolerated in the study, demonstrating a favorable safety profile. Jasper also announced the completion of its internal investigation into the anomalous lack of clinical response observed in the July 2025 BEACON data for cohort 8 (240mg Q8W) and cohort 9 (240mg /180mg Q8W), where no US patients (n=10) achieved Complete Response or Well Controlled UAS7 by week 12. Based on the work completed, the additional data from subsequent dosing of the US patients and input from a panel of CSU KOLs, Jasper has concluded that the unexpected efficacy results observed in the US patients was not the result of any issues with the drug product. Rather, it was likely a result of patient selection issues, as it appears that 9 of the 10 patients in question did not have CSU as their symptoms were not mast cell-driven. am pleased to see the initial results of the ETESIAN study, the first clinical study to evaluate an agent specifically targeting mast cells in asthma patients\" said Dr. Elliot Israel, Director of Clinical Research in the Pulmonary and Critical Care Division at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \"The initial results demonstrate the potential to reduce both airway hyperresponsiveness and the accumulation of eosinophils in the airways, both of which are key factors in managing chronic asthma and reducing exacerbations. Given that a substantial portion of asthma patients remain underserved by currently approved therapies, depleting mast cells through KIT inhibition may represent an intriguing new treatment option for patients with chronic asthma.\" \"We are very pleased to present the positive preliminary data from the ETESIAN study, which demonstrates proof of concept for mast cell depletion using briquilimab as a potential therapeutic option for patients with asthma,\" said Dr. Daniel Adelman, Acting Chief Medical Officer of Jasper. \"Mast cells are believed to be a key driver of the inflammatory cascade underlying chronic asthma, and both the reductions in airway hyperresponsiveness and the significant reduction in sputum eosinophils demonstrated at 6 weeks after a single 180mg dose of briquilimab strongly support the potential of mast cell depletion to drive a therapeutic benefit for asthma patients. These data, combined with the favorable safety profile observed in the ETESIAN study and in other briquilimab clinical studies, provide a strong rationale for further development of briquilimab in asthma. On behalf of the entire Jasper team, I'd like to thank the investigators and the patients who participated in the study, along with their families and caregivers.\" ETESIAN Study Design and Preliminary Data Summary: The Phase 1b/2a ETESIAN study was a single dose double-blind, placebo-controlled challenge study that enrolled approximately 17 patients across 6 sites in Canada. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate proof-of-concept for briquilimab in asthma utilizing a potentially therapeutic dose to inform future trials in the broader asthma population. The study was conducted utilizing a single 180mg dose of subcutaneous briquilimab and key assessments included both EAR measured at 6 weeks, and LAR measured at 12 weeks, changes in airway hyperresponsiveness, mast cell depletion and recovery, and safety. preliminary data includes the results from 14 participants, 8 receiving a single dose of 180mg briquilimab and 6 receiving placebo, who completed at least 6 weeks of allergen challenge testing following initial dosing with investigational product. Compared to baseline, briquilimab reduced the allergen induced LAR (measured by the mean maximum percentage fall in FEV (%Max FEV ) and fall in area under the FEV time response curve (AUC)) at both 6 and 12 weeks. Patients who received briquilimab showed an improvement in the LAR %Max FEV of 10.4% at 6 weeks and 8.7% at 12 weeks compared to baseline and an improvement in the LAR AUC of 25.4% at 6 weeks and 23.3% at 12 weeks. 180mg Single-Dose Asthmatic Response Assessments at Week 6 and Week 12 6-Week Change (Baseline to Day 42) 12-Week Change (Baseline to Day 84) % Max FEV % Max FEV Early Asthmatic Response, 0-2 Hours (EAR) Briquilimab (n=8) 12.74 18.27 10.56 Placebo (n=6) Late Asthmatic Response, 2-7 Hours (LAR) Briquilimab (n=7) 10.37 25.35 23.34 Placebo (n=5) Patient airway hyperresponsiveness was also assessed pre- and post-allergen challenge by methacholine PD20. At baseline, prior to administration of briquilimab, patients randomized to both the placebo group and the briquilimab group had similar drops in the ratio of post- to pre-allergen challenge methacholine PD20 (dose of methacholine required to drive a 20% decrease in FEV ) following allergen challenge of 0.50 and 0.46, respectively. At the week 6 challenge the shift in the methacholine PD20 response was 0.40 for placebo and 0.63 for briquilimab and at the week 12 challenge the shift was 0.60 for placebo and 1.58 for briquilimab indicating an increased resistance to methacholine following allergen in patients dosed with briquilimab. Treatment with briquilimab also decreased levels of sputum eosinophils before and after allergen challenge. Patients in the briquilimab group had reduced mean sputum eosinophil levels at pre allergen challenge timepoints of 1.88% at baseline to 0.44% at day 41 and 0.38% at day 83. Briquilimab also reduced mean sputum eosinophil levels 24 hours following allergen challenge. At baseline, prior to briquilimab dosing, patients randomized to the briquilimab group had a 24-hour post allergen challenge eosinophil level of 10.3%. Following dosing of briquilimab the 24-hour post allergen challenge eosinophil level was 2.32% at 6 weeks and 3.98% at 12 weeks. Briquilimab was well-tolerated in the study, with no dose limiting toxicities observed. Safety observations potentially related to KIT blockade were infrequent and generally limited to low grade events, none of which resulted in discontinuations or dose delays and the majority of which resolved during repeat dosing. BEACON Cohort 8 & Cohort 9 Internal Investigation Concluded Jasper announced the completion of its internal investigation into the anomalous lack of clinical response observed in the July 2025 BEACON data for cohort 8 (240mg Q8W) and cohort 9 (240mg/180mg Q8W), where no US patients (n=10) achieved Complete Response or Well Controlled UAS7 by week 12. In response, Jasper's internal investigation included: switching all US patients to a new lot of drug product for the remainder of their doses on study to determine if drug product played a role, comprehensive review of all manufacturing records, drug handling, site training/ logs and data handling, recovery and testing by Jasper and independent labs of drug product samples from across the supply chain, a review of all US sites and all US patients, including protocol adherence patient medical histories, patient screening and all pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy data, and assembling a KOL panel to review the internal investigation findings, including full patient dossiers, which provided its input and conclusions from the findings. The investigation has been completed, and based on the work completed, the additional data from subsequent dosing of the US patients and input from the KOL panel, Jasper has concluded that the unexpected lack of efficacy observed in the US patients was not the result of any issues with drug product, but rather appears to be the result of patient selection issues, specifically the fact that it appears that 9 of the 10 patients did not have CSU as their disease did not appear to be mast-cell driven. This is specifically evidenced by the fact that 8 of the 9 patients continued to demonstrate consistent pharmacodynamic responses despite no improvement in UAS7 scores. \"I commend the Jasper team for the professional manner in which they managed the anomalous results received in July, by promptly notifying clinical sites and conducting a thorough investigation into the root cause,\" said Martin Metz, M.D., Professor of Dermatology and Allergy Charit Universittsmedizin Berlin and member of the KOL panel. \"While it appears that 9 of the 10 patients enrolled in the US sites likely did not have mast cell-driven CSU, their data still provide valuable insights into the pharmacodynamics and the safety profile of briquilimab. I'm very encouraged with the overall profile of briquilimab to date, and I look forward to seeing additional data in early 2026.\" \"We are very pleased to be able to close out our internal investigation of the anomalous results seen in the BEACON data released in July and very grateful to Dr. Metz and the other KOLs who supported the rapid completion of this effort,\" said Ronald Martell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Jasper. \"Going forward, we are confident that the learnings from this investigation and the recommendations from our KOLs will help us minimize the enrollment of patients that may not have mast cell-driven disease. Most importantly, we are very pleased that the internal investigation demonstrated that there were no issues with the drug product utilized in the study, and we are looking forward to the last wave of BEACON data expected in Q1 2026 that will enable us to select final doses for the Phase 2b CSU study, planned to commence mid-2026.\" Conference Call / Webinar Jasper will host a conference call and webinar today at 8:00 a.m. ET, including remarks from Dr. Martin Metz, M.D., Professor of Dermatology and Allergy Charit Universittsmedizin Berlin and the principal European investigator on the BEACON study. A live question and answer session with management will follow the formal presentation. A link to the webinar, including presentation slides, can be found here. The presentation slides and a link to the live and archived webcast will also be available on the Events & News Events page of Jasper's Investor Relations website. About Jasper Jasper is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing briquilimab as a therapeutic for chronic mast cell diseases. Briquilimab is a targeted aglycosylated monoclonal antibody that blocks stem cell factor from binding to the cell-surface receptor KIT, thereby inhibiting signaling through the receptor. This inhibition disrupts the critical survival signal, leading to the depletion of the mast cells via apoptosis which removes the underlying source of the inflammatory response in mast cell driven diseases such as chronic urticaria and asthma. Jasper is currently conducting clinical studies of briquilimab as a treatment in patients with CSU, CIndU, and asthma. Briquilimab has a demonstrated efficacy and safety profile in patients and healthy volunteers, with positive clinical outcomes in both CSU, CIndU and asthma.

30% of patients are incorrectly diagnosed KOL panel recommendations to ensure quality patient selection Ensure sites utilized have a certified Immunologist/Dermatologist with a history of diagnosing and treating CSU patients Expanded review of patient history during screening including visual records of lesions Larger sample size in future studies should mitigate impact of non -

specific therapeutic targeting mast cells has demonstrated potential for the treatment of asthma PK/PD demonstrated deep & sustained biologic activity in key biomarkers, including: Serum tryptase Sputum eosinophils Robust improvements observed in both aspects of the challenge study: Improvement in mean FEV1 response seen at week 6 and week 12 in allergen challenge Reductions in airway hyper - responsiveness observed in the methacoline challenge Data suggest that mast cells play a central role in airway inflammation Given that the mast cell may be a central actor in both T2 high and T2 low disease, further developme nt in the broader asthma population is warranted Next steps being evaluated, including potential dose - ranging/repeat dose studies in asthma Next Steps Ron Martell, CEO 30 BRIQUILIMAB IS AN INVESTIGATIVE DRUG AND IS NOT APPROVED FOR ANY INDICATION Program Status and Next Steps Briquilimab development in mast - cell driven diseases continues to advance in multiple indications CSU - Briquilimab continues to demonstrate rapid onset, deep clinical response and favorable safety profile More than 24pt drop in UAS7 with 82% CR and 91% WC disease by week 4 with single dose (240mg SD & 360mg SD, n=11) Highly effective in OLE study at 180mg Q8W with 73% CR and 82% WC disease at 12 weeks (n=11) Continued favorable safety profile, r epeat dose of 240mg Q8W and 240mg/180mg Q8W were generally well tolerated CSU -

To date, 22 participants have been treated in the REVEAL-1 Cohort and are included in safety analyses, with 6-month follow-up efficacy data reported for 17. Three participants withdrew or were lost to follow up and two participants experienced protocol deviations. Participants maintained stable weight after a single Revita procedure, with a mean total body weight change of 1.5% 1.3% (SEM; n=17) at 6 months. Published third-party studies report ~10% weight regain by this time point after GLP-1 withdrawal alone. Minimal change in HbA1c levels was observed after the Revita procedure (0.04% 0.08%; SEM; n=17), compared to the ~0.4% increase in HbA1c seen post-GLP-1 discontinuation in the STEP-1 trial extension of GLP-1 withdrawal. These results indicate the potential for Revita to help stabilize cardiometabolic parameters beyond weight loss alone. Mean body weight and HbA1c curves showed a stable and durable trajectory over time, consistent with prior Revita clinical study and real-world experience. These results are encouraging for potential longer-term durability of weight maintenance and metabolic control. No procedure-related serious adverse events were observed; 8 of 22 participants (36%) experienced mild treatment-emergent adverse events which were transient, and self-limited; all consistent with prior Revita experience and similar to routine upper endoscopy findings.

(Nasdaq: GUTS) (the Company or Fractyl), a metabolic therapeutics company focused on pioneering pattern-breaking approaches that treat root causes of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), today announced positive 6-month results from its open-label REVEAL-1 Cohort. The REVEAL-1 Cohort is an open-label study in individuals with obesity who have lost at least 15% of their total body weight on a GLP-1 medication and who either need or choose to discontinue GLP-1 therapy. The REVEAL-1 data show that patients who underwent a single Revita procedure after discontinuing GLP-1 therapy maintained both stable body weight and glycemic control through 6 months. The new results highlight Revita's potential as a compelling first-in-class therapy for post-GLP-1 weight maintenance. Key Findings: Hard-to-treat GLP-1 responder population: Participants lost 24% total body weight (>50 lbs.) on GLP-1 drugs prior to enrollment (duration on GLP-1 therapy ranging from 5 months to 5 years.) Safety and efficacy data through 6 months are available for 22 and 17 participants, respectively. Sustained weight maintenance : Participants maintained stable weight after a single Revita procedure, with a mean total body weight change of 1.5% 1.3% (SEM; n=17) at 6 months. Published third-party studies report ~10% weight regain by this time point after GLP-1 withdrawal alone (see Figure 1.) Sustained glycemic control: Minimal change in HbA1c levels was observed after the Revita procedure (0.04% 0.08%; SEM; n=17), compared to the ~0.4% increase in HbA1c seen post-GLP-1 discontinuation in the STEP-1 trial extension of GLP-1 withdrawal. These results indicate the potential for Revita to help stabilize cardiometabolic parameters beyond weight loss alone. Stable metabolic trajectory from 1 month 3 months to 6 months: Mean body weight and HbA1c curves showed a stable and durable trajectory over time, consistent with prior Revita clinical study and real-world experience . These results are encouraging for potential longer-term durability of weight maintenance and metabolic control. Excellent tolerability : No procedure-related serious adverse events were observed; 8 of 22 participants (36%) experienced mild treatment-emergent adverse events which were transient and self-limited; all consistent with prior Revita experience and similar to routine upper endoscopy findings. Reproducible procedure performance: Average ablation length was approximately 16 cm (n=22), consistent with Revita European real-world experience and the ongoing REMAIN-1 Pivotal study, supporting the potential translatability of results and scalability of technique. Aronne et al. JAMA. 2024;331(1):3848. doi:10.1001/jama.2023.24945 Wilding et al. Diabetes Obes Metab. 2022 Aug;24(8):1553-1564 \"Many patients desperately need an off-ramp from GLP-1 drugs. These six-month REVEAL-1 results are an important milestone in our understanding of the potential durability and trajectory of post-GLP-1 weight and metabolic maintenance with Revita,\" said Adarsh M. Thaker, M.D., Assistant Clinical Professor, Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. \"We know from experience that most patients begin regaining weight within weeks of stopping GLP-1 therapy, so seeing such sustained effects out to six months after a single Revita procedure is remarkable. This durability points to Revita's potential as an important new strategy for long-term metabolic health and a new path forward for patients seeking to stay off chronic drug therapy.\" \"These new data underscore Revita's potential to support weight maintenance after GLP-1 discontinuation,\" said Harith Rajagopalan, M.D., Ph.D., Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Fractyl Health. \"REVEAL-1 builds on the strong foundation we have established over years of development and gives us even greater confidence as we approach a pivotal year ahead. Revita has obtained FDA Breakthrough Device designation for post-GLP-1 weight maintenance, underscoring the urgency of the medical problem. We have seen rapid clinical enrollment in our pivotal REMAIN-1 study and have also observed an urgent need from patients, prescribers, and payers for a scalable, non-drug alternative in obesity. We are executing with focus and discipline, and the momentum across our programs continues to accelerate as we move closer to bringing this product candidate to patients who need it most.\" Advancing Toward Value-Driving Catalysts in 2026 Fractyl is advancing toward multiple anticipated clinical readouts from the ongoing REMAIN weight maintenance program: January 2026: 6-month randomized data from the REMAIN-1 Midpoint Cohort Q2 2026: 1-year REVEAL-1 Cohort data Q3 2026: 1-year REMAIN-1 Midpoint Cohort data H2 2026: Topline 6-month randomized data from REMAIN-1 Pivotal Cohort H2 2026: Potential Revita PMA filing in post-GLP-1 weight maintenance About REVEAL-1 The REVEAL-1 Cohort (n=22) is an open-label study in individuals living with obesity who have lost at least 15% of their total body weight on a GLP-1 medication and who either need or choose to discontinue GLP-1 therapy. After stopping the GLP-1 drug, participants receive the Revita treatment in an open-label setting. REVEAL-1 is designed to provide early, real-world insights on how Revita performs after GLP-1 discontinuation. To date, 22 participants have been treated in the REVEAL-1 Cohort and are included in safety analyses, with 6-month follow-up efficacy data reported for 17. Three participants withdrew or were lost to follow up and two participants experienced protocol deviations. The profile of the REVEAL-1 Cohort closely mirrors that of the REMAIN-1 Midpoint and Pivotal Cohorts, with an average age of 50 and a gender distribution of 86% women. All 22 participants had previously been treated with a GLP-1 therapy for durations ranging from approximately 5 months to 5 years, with a mean total body weight loss of 24% while on therapy and a mean body weight of 80 kg 3 kg (SEM) at the time of intervention. About Fractyl Health Fractyl Health is a metabolic therapeutics company focused on pioneering new approaches to the treatment of metabolic diseases, including obesity and T2D.

Revita is designed to remodel the duodenal lining via hydrothermal ablation (i.e. duodenal mucosal resurfacing) to reverse damage to intestinal nutrient sensing and signaling mechanisms caused by chronic high-fat and high-sugar diets that are a root cause of metabolic disease. In the U.S., Revita is for investigational use only under U.S. law. Revita has U.S. FDA Breakthrough Device designation in weight maintenance for people with obesity who discontinue GLP-1 based drugs. A pivotal study of Revita in patients with obesity after discontinuation of GLP-1 based drugs, called REMAIN-1, was initiated in the third quarter of 2024 and has completed enrollment.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981359243392944}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.997983455657959}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992757439613342}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9973171353340149}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981088638305664}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.7563518285751343}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992289543151855}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995288848876953}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9768953323364258}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9942296743392944}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9728994965553284}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9974989295005798}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.5332358479499817}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981642365455627}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.994326651096344}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9951056241989136}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9922235608100891}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9064632058143616}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993711113929749}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.8021310567855835}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9742041826248169}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9979434609413147}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9812116622924805}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9979175925254822}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9972363710403442}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9984005093574524}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9978246688842773}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9978006482124329}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9983123540878296}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9978649020195007}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9972923398017883}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9983171224594116}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9991969466209412}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.998889148235321}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9990469813346863}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9893473386764526}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9404283761978149}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9987351298332214}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9956420660018921}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9982859492301941}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993847608566284}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995747208595276}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993287324905396}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9781816601753235}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993288516998291}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9980379939079285}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9762203693389893}], "sentiment": "positive"}], "overall_sentiment": "positive", "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": null}, "000102085925000063": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1020859/000102085925000063/unfi-20251202.htm", "filing_date": "Tue, 2 Dec 2025 07:02:35 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": true, "ticker": "UNFI", "items": {"item 2.02": {"text": "Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

Our third quarter comparable store sales growth of 10.8%, 16.5% on a two-year stack basis, represents our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comp performance, bringing our year-to-date comp to 10.0%, and 12.3% on a two-year stack basis. We're experiencing broad-based momentum at Citi Trends, with sales growth spanning all store volume groups, geographies, and product categories, highlighting the comprehensive nature of our business improvement. Importantly, increased traffic is driving the majority of our sales growth. We delivered a strong back-to-school season fueled by continued momentum in our Children's, Mens and Basic apparel divisions. We continue to sharpen our product and value for our core customer, and in the quarter we saw strong response to elevated brands and fashion for the Fall, as well as strong response to early holiday assortments late in the quarter. As a result, our sales momentum has continued fourth quarter to date. I'm also excited to announce that this holiday season we are launching the rebranded Citi Trends \"Joy Looks Good on You\" campaign and updated social media presence under the \"@wearecititrends\" tagline. Moving ahead, we remain committed to enhancing our operational processes and strengthening our capabilities as we work to capture the substantial growth opportunities before us. We have established a clear line of sight to achieve approximately $45 million of EBITDA* in fiscal 2027, which would represent a $60 million improvement from 2024 levels. While we're in the early stages of what I believe will be a compelling transformation, we have built a definitive, actionable and internally controllable plan to accelerate shareholder value creation over the next few years.\" Financial Highlights Third Quarter 2025 Total sales of $197.1 million increased $18.0 million, or 10.1% vs. Q3 2024; comparable store sales increased 10.8% compared to Q3 2024 driven by increases in traffic, basket and conversion, reflecting the impact of the three-tiered merchandise assortment, including more trendy product, off-price deals and more branded extreme value product.

the following pro forma adjustments: Versace Disposal Adjustments: These adjustments reflect the elimination of assets, liabilities, equity and operations attributable to Versace. This disposal meets the criteria for Versace to be presented as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements Discontinued Operations. Transaction Accounting Adjustments: Reflects $1.375 billion of estimated cash consideration received from Prada from the sale of Versace. No adjustment has been made to the sale proceeds to give effect to any potential post-closing adjustments under the terms of the Agreement. Subsequent to September 27, 2025, the Company anticipates it will incur additional non-recurring costs of approximately $12 million of Transaction advisory and professional fees to be incurred to complete the Transaction. Reflects an estimated gain of $104 million related to the sale of Versace based on an estimate of (i) $1.375 billion of cash consideration, less (ii) Versace net assets as of September 27, 2025 of $1.229 billion, less (iii) estimated transaction costs of $12 million noted above in (b), and less (iv) certain prepayments of $25 million noted below in (d) and less (v) indemnification and other liabilities expected to be recorded at close of approximately $5 million. The actual gain recorded upon close will not equal this estimated gain of $104 million as it will be based on amounts as of the closing date. Since the unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations only include continuing operations, the estimated gain on sale is not included in any period presented. As part of the estimated cash consideration transferred of $1.375 billion, approximately $25 million was considered a prepayment by Prada related to certain transition services that will be provided by the Company post-close and not otherwise compensated to the Company, reflected in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. In addition, approximately $5 million of indemnification and other liabilities are expected to be recorded at close related to seller obligations triggered by the sale. Reflects the estimated $729 million repayment of the 2025 Term Loans and write-off of related unamortized deferred financing costs of $5 million within Long-term debt as of September 27, 2025, which is required in connection with the sale of Versace, pursuant to the mandatory repayment provisions of the Company's Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as well as the associated accrued interest repayment of $3 million within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities as part of the Transaction. The write-off of deferred financing costs partially offsets the reduction of interest expense for the year ended March 29, 2025 as described in (f). Retained earnings reflects an increase of $1.328 billion related to the sale of Versace based on (i) the historical retained earnings of $1.229 billion related to the net assets of Versace noted above in (c), plus (ii) the estimated gain of $104 million noted above in (c), and less (iii) the impact of the write-off of related unamortized deferred financing costs of $5 million in connection with the sale of Versace, pursuant to the mandatory repayment provisions of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement noted above in (e). Reflects the reduction of interest expense of $20 million and $6 million for the six months ended September 27, 2025, and the year ended March 29, 2025, respectively, which represents the period for which the 2025 Term Loans were outstanding and interest related to the 2025 Term Loans was expensed, to give effect to the repayment of debt described in (e) above. The disposal of Versace is estimated to result in a capital loss for income tax purposes. Due to a lack of available income to realize the capital loss, the Company estimates it will not recognize an associated income tax benefit.

(NASDAQ: DRVN) (\"Driven Brands\" or the \"Company\") today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell IMO, its international car wash business to Franchise Equity Partners. \"This transaction sharpens our focus on what we do best scaling Take 5 and driving consistent cash generation through our Franchise Brands,\" said Danny Rivera, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"IMO is a good business, but it is not core to our long-term strategy. By exiting it, we simplify our portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet, and position Driven Brands to create greater value for shareholders.\" Under the terms of the agreement, Franchise Equity Partners will acquire IMO for 406 million, based on IMO's balance sheet as of June 30, 2025, which amount is not subject to post-closing adjustments for cash, debt or working capital. The agreement includes customary 'locked box' protections against certain types of financial leakage, and a customary 'ticker' whereby the purchase price increases daily by a fixed amount in Euros from July 1, 2025, to the closing date. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to receipt of specified regulatory approvals. \"The divestiture of our international car wash business helps accelerate our path towards de-levering balance sheet while maintaining operational focus on our core, North American businesses. This transaction will reduce pro forma leverage by approximately 0.3x and demonstrates our commitment to achieve 3x net leverage by the end of 2026,\" said Mike Diamond, Chief Financial Officer. Cash proceeds from the transaction will primarily be used to pay down debt and general corporate purposes. The Company plans to report the results of the Car Wash segment as discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2025. Auto Glass Now, currently reported in the Corporate & Other segment, will be reported as a stand-alone segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2025. In conjunction with the divestiture, the Company updated its financial outlook from continuing operations for the fiscal year ending December 27, 2025, to reflect the reclassification of the international car wash business as discontinued operations as follows: 2025 Outlook Revenue ~$1.85 - $1.87 billion Adjusted EBITDA ~$445 - $455 million The Company now expects Adjusted Diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $1.18 to $1.23 on a preliminary basis, subject to final determination of income tax impacts related to the divestiture. With the reclassification of the international car wash business to discontinued operations, the Company now expects same store sales growth to be slightly below the low end of its original range of 1% to 3%. The Company continues to expect net store growth of approximately 175 to 200. On a pro forma basis, reflecting the divestiture of the international car was business, the Company now expects capital expenditures as a percent of revenue from continuing operations to be approximately 6.5% 7.0% of sales.

Thompson, EVP and CFO FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (301) 429-4638 URBAN ONE, INC. ANNOUNCES EARLY RESULTS OF OFFERS AND CONSENT SOLICITATION Silver Spring, MD Urban One, Inc. (NASDAQ: UONEK and UONE) (the \"Company\") today announced the early results of the previously announced offers: (a) to exchange (the \"Exchange Offer\") any and all of the Company's outstanding 7.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the \"Existing Notes\") held by Eligible Holders (as defined below) for newly issued 7.625% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the \"Exchange Notes\"), to be issued by the Company, and cash, (b) to purchase (the \"Tender Offer\") up to $185.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes for up to $111.0 million in cash and (c) the right to subscribe to purchase (the \"Subscription Offer\" and, together with the Exchange Offer and the Tender Offer, collectively, the \"Offers\") up to $60.6 million in aggregate principal amount of newly issued 10.500% First Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2030 (the \"New First Lien Notes\" and, together with the Exchange Notes, the \"New Notes\"). As of 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on December 1, 2025 (the \"Early Tender Date\"), the Company received from Eligible Holders valid and unwithdrawn tenders and related Consents (as defined below), as reported by D.F. King & Co., Inc. (the \"Exchange Agent\"), representing approximately $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes, or approximately 92.2% of the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes outstanding. Eligible Holders electing to participate in: (a) only the Exchange Offer are referred to herein as \"Exchange Offer Only Participants,\" (b) the Exchange Offer and the Tender Offer are referred to herein as \"Exchange Offer and Tender Offer Participants,\" (c) the Exchange Offer, the Tender Offer and the Subscription Offer are referred to herein as \"Exchange Offer, Tender Offer and Subscription Offer Participants,\" and (d) the Exchange Offer and the Subscription Offer are referred to herein as \"Exchange Offer and Subscription Offer Participants.\" The Exchange Offer and Tender Offer Participants and the Exchange Offer, Tender Offer and Subscription Offer Participants are collectively referred to herein as the \"Tender Offer Participants.\" As of the Early Tender Date, $480,000 in aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes were tendered by Exchange Offer Only Participants and Exchange Offer and Subscription Offer Participants to receive the Exchange Consideration and approximately $449.5 million in aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes were tendered by Exchange Offer and Tender Offer Participants and Exchange Offer, Tender Offer and Subscription Offer Participants to receive the Tender Consideration. Because Existing Notes in a principal amount greater than $185.0 million were tendered into the Tender Offer, the Tender Offer is oversubscribed, and Existing Notes accepted in the Tender Offer will be subject to proration, as described below. Prior to the Early Tender Date, Eligible Holders (other than the Supporting Noteholders (as defined below)) subscribed to purchase approximately $4.7 million in aggregate principal amount of New First Lien Notes. Following the Early Tender Date, Eligible Holders may no longer elect to participate in the Subscription Offer. To be eligible to participate in the Subscription Offer, Eligible Holders were required to tender all of their Existing Notes in the Exchange Offer only or in the Exchange Offer and Tender Offer at or prior to the Early Tender Date and must deliver in cash an amount equal to the purchase price therefor by 11:59 P.M, New York City time, on December 3, 2025. As previously announced, pursuant to a Transaction Support Agreement, dated as of November 14, 2025, by and among the Company and certain holders (the \"Supporting Noteholders\") of Existing Notes, the Supporting Noteholders have agreed to backstop the full Subscription Offer and are expected to purchase the remaining approximately $55.9 million in aggregate principal amount of New First Lien Notes. In addition, as of the Early Tender Date, the Company received the requisite number of consents (the \"Consents\") in the concurrent consent solicitation (the \"Consents\" and such solicitation, the \"Consent Solicitation\") from Eligible Holders of the Existing Notes to adopt certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing the Existing Notes (the \"Existing Notes Indenture\") to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain of the default provisions, modify covenants regarding mergers and consolidations and modify or eliminate certain other provisions, including removing the requirement that the Company make an offer to repurchase the Existing Notes if the Company experiences certain change of control transactions, releasing the guarantees provided by the guarantors of the Existing Notes, and eliminating any requirement to provide guarantees in the future with respect to the Existing Notes, releasing the liens on all of the collateral securing the Existing Notes and eliminating any requirement to provide collateral in the future with respect to the Existing Notes (collectively, the \"Proposed Amendments\"). Promptly after the Early Tender Date, the Company intends to enter into a supplemental indenture with the trustee for the Existing Notes and the guarantors party thereto to reflect the Proposed Amendments, but the Proposed Amendments will become operative only upon, and subject to, the consummation of the Exchange Offer and Tender Offer. As of 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on December 1, 2025, the right to withdraw tenders of Existing Notes and related Consents expired. Accordingly, Existing Notes tendered for exchange at or before such time may not be validly withdrawn and Consents may no longer be revoked, unless required by applicable law, or the Company determines in the future in its sole discretion to permit withdrawal and revocation rights. The Offers and the Consent Solicitation will expire at 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on December 15, 2025, unless extended (such time and date as it may be extended, the \"Expiration Date\") or earlier terminated. Each participating Eligible Holder must tender all of the Existing Notes it holds for purchase in the Tender Offer and/or exchange in the Exchange Offer through The Depository Trust Company's Automated Tender Offer Program (\"ATOP\"). Partial tenders of Existing Notes will not be accepted. Following the Early Tender Date, within ATOP, each participating Eligible Holder must tender all of the Existing Notes it holds into the appropriate contra-CUSIP corresponding with its decision to participate as (1) an Exchange Offer Only Participant or (2) an Exchange Offer and Tender Offer Participant. Eligible Holders will only be entitled to participate in the Tender Offer if they elect to exchange all of their Existing Notes in the Exchange Offer other than those Existing Notes, if any, accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer.

(2) No representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP numbers or ISINs listed in this press release or in the Offering Memorandum or printed on the Existing Notes. Such CUSIP numbers and ISINs are provided solely for the convenience of the holders of the Existing Notes. (3) Any accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes accepted for exchange or purchase, as applicable, in the Exchange Offer and/or Tender Offer to, but not including, the settlement date for the Offers will be paid in cash at settlement. (4) The maximum principal amount of Existing Notes that will be accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer is $185.0 million, and the maximum amount of cash consideration that will be paid for Existing Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Tender Offer is $111.0 million.

To the extent Existing Notes in a principal amount greater than $185.0 million are tendered into the Tender Offer, the Tender Offer will be oversubscribed, and Existing Notes accepted in the Tender Offer will be subject to proration. In such case, the amount of Existing Notes that will be accepted in the Tender Offer for each Tender Offer Participant will be equal to the product of (a) the aggregate principal amount of Existing Notes tendered by such Tender Offer Participant and (b) the quotient of $185.0 million (the \"Tender Cap\") divided by the total principal amount of Existing Notes validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Tender Offer.

Subject to applicable law, the Company may amend, extend, terminate or withdraw any of the Offers and/or Consent Solicitation without amending, extending, terminating or withdrawing any of the others, at any time and for any reason, including if any of the conditions set forth under \"Conditions to the Offers and Consent Solicitation\" in the Offering Memorandum with respect to the Offers are not satisfied as determined by the Company in its sole discretion.

FluentStream is expected to generate $24-$25 million in revenue and $9.5-$10.5 million of adjusted EBITDA annually, based on current run rates, and be accretive to Ooma's Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per share starting on December 1, 2025. FluentStream, founded in 2010 and headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is a cloud communications/UCaaS provider with a strong channel/partner program. Much like Ooma Office , FluentStream provides voice, text, mobile, and callcenter features, and supports remote/hybrid workforces, with a strong emphasis on customer service and reliability. The company has grown significantly over the last several years through a series of acquisitions and now serves approximately 5,000 customers and 80,000 users. Most of FluentStream's customers are served by FluentStream's proprietary UCaaS platform and U.S. based customer support. Ooma will host its Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Results Conference Call on December 8, 2025 after market close, during which management will discuss financial results as well as the transaction and its impact on fiscal 2026 financial guidance. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to disclosing estimates of financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), this press release contains estimates of Adjusted EBITDA in future periods. As explained in Ooma's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest and other income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and related taxes, litigation costs, restructuring costs and gain on note conversion. This non-GAAP financial measure is presented in this press release to provide investors with the expected annualized impact of the business to be acquired by Ooma. In general, Ooma considers its non-GAAP financial measures to be useful measures of the operating performance of the company, because they contain adjustments for unusual events or factors that do not directly affect what management considers to be Ooma's core operating performance and are used by the company's management for that purpose. Adjusted EBITDA is also a useful measure of Ooma's ability to service debt. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that the adjustments to the directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), relate to items that the company generally expects to continue to recognize. The adjustment of these items should not be construed as an inference that the adjusted gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, both GAAP financial measure of Ooma's financial performance and the related non-GAAP measure should be considered together, when available. Reconciliations of estimated annualized Adjusted EBITDA to full-year estimates of GAAP net income (loss) have not been provided due to the unreasonable efforts it would take to provide such reconciliations due to the high variability, complexity and uncertainty with respect to forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "positive", "score": 0.9979597330093384}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9978206157684326}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9960594177246094}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9985758066177368}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9982781410217285}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995276927947998}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996210336685181}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996294975280762}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996144771575928}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996137022972107}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996114373207092}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995321035385132}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995844960212708}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996175765991211}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995235204696655}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996267557144165}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.8380405902862549}], "sentiment": "positive"}], "overall_sentiment": "positive", "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": null}, "000145293625000121": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1452936/000145293625000121/pacoaksor-20251130.htm", "filing_date": "Mon, 1 Dec 2025 18:39:23 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": false, "ticker": null, "items": {}, "exhibits": [], "overall_sentiment": null, "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": "Missing ticker or items"}, "000091854125000156": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/918541/000091854125000156/nnbr-20251201.htm", "filing_date": "Mon, 1 Dec 2025 18:29:32 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": true, "ticker": "NNBR", "items": {"item 7.01": {"text": "NN, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\"), will present at the Noble Capital Markets' Twenty First Annual Emerging Growth Equity Conference (the \"Conference\") on December 3, 2025.

Blackstone Real Estate will retain 100% of the common equity ownership of the real estate and the real estate will continue to be operated by MGM Resorts International. This represents Realty Income's second investment with Blackstone Real Estate, following the successful Bellagio Las Vegas joint venture completed in 2023. In conjunction with today's announcement, Realty Income is increasing its 2025 investment volume outlook to over $6.0 billion. The perpetual preferred equity investment is expected to carry an unlevered initial rate of return to Realty Income of 7.4% with annual, capped escalators starting on the fifth anniversary of the closing. The preferred equity investment is subject to an early redemption premium payable to Realty Income of 3% of the preferred equity amount if redeemed prior to the first anniversary of closing, or 2% of the preferred equity amount if redeemed after the first anniversary but before the fourth anniversary of closing. Upon redemption of the preferred equity amount, if Realty Income has not received an 8.325% unlevered IRR on the redeemed amount, it will receive a make-whole payment to ensure that such return is achieved. Realty Income will retain a right of first offer on a future sale of the common equity interests in the real estate by Blackstone Real Estate. \"We are pleased to build on our strategic relationship with Blackstone Real Estate to invest in one of the Las Vegas Strip's iconic properties,\" said Sumit Roy, Realty Income's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"This represents an immediately accretive investment for Realty Income with a favorable initial yield and IRR profile, further demonstrating the value of our size, scale, and diversification. This transaction adds to an active fourth quarter investment pipeline, which is expected to be fully funded from an equity standpoint from a combination of cash, anticipated free cash flow and equity, of which Realty Income had approximately $417 million of outstanding cash as of the end of the third quarter, and approximately $1.3 billion of unsettled forward equity as of today.\" Jacob Werner, Co-Head of Americas Acquisitions for Blackstone Real Estate, said: \"We are pleased to reach this agreement and grow our partnership with Realty Income. This preferred equity investment is a terrific outcome for our investors as it returns significant capital while preserving our ownership in a world-class resort at the heart of the Las Vegas Strip.\" The property is subject to an existing triple net lease with annual rent escalators and approximately 26 years of remaining initial term, plus three 10-year extension options. In-place rent is significantly well-covered through existing property cash flows.

(the \"Company\") filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a one-for-ten (1-for-10) reverse stock split (the \"Reverse Stock Split\") of its common stock, par value $0.0001 (the \"Common Stock\"), effective on December 12, 2025 at 12:01 am Eastern Time (the \"Effective Time\"). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, at the Effective Time, every ten (10) shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding will be automatically combined and converted into one (1) issued and outstanding share of Common Stock. The Reverse Stock Split will not change the authorized number of shares or the par value of the Common Stock, nor modify any voting rights of the Common Stock. The Reverse Stock Split is intended to enable the Company to regain compliance with the Nasdaq $1.00 minimum bid price requirement, the compliance period for which has been extended through December 29, 2025. There can be no assurance that the trading price of the Common Stock will remain at or above $1.00 per share following the Reverse Stock Split. The Company's Common Stock will continue trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market (\"Nasdaq\") under its existing symbol \"BNAI\" and will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on December 12, 2025. At the Effective Time, the new CUSIP number for the Common Stock will be 104932 207. The Company's public warrants will continue trading on Nasdaq under the existing symbol \"BNAIW.\" No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. In lieu of any interest in a fractional share to which a stockholder would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, such holder shall be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the closing price of the Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market on the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time. Cash payments for fractional shares will be mailed by the exchange agent promptly after the Effective Time and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Also, at the Effective Time, based on the 1-for-10 split ratio, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under our outstanding equity awards will decrease proportionately, with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole share, with a corresponding adjustment made to the exercise prices of outstanding option awards, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. In addition, the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under our equity incentive plans will be proportionately adjusted based on the 1-for-10 split ratio, such that fewer shares will be available for issuance under our equity incentive plans. Further, at the Effective Time, all outstanding warrants will be adjusted in accordance with their terms, which will result in the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant holder's aggregate number of warrants, after adjustment, being rounded down to the nearest whole share and proportionate adjustments will be made to the exercise price. Our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, is acting as the exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split. Registered stockholders holding pre-split shares of the Company's Common Stock electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares. Stockholders owning shares via a broker, bank, trust or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, subject to such broker's particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Certificate of Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9444878697395325}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994787573814392}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994890689849854}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9946540594100952}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.6354004144668579}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995361566543579}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994996786117554}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994416832923889}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994743466377258}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993699193000793}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995542168617249}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992897510528564}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992524981498718}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995740056037903}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994685053825378}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995558857917786}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999170184135437}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995916485786438}], "sentiment": "neutral"}, "item 9.01": {"text": "(d) Exhibits Exhibit Number Description 3.1 Certificate of Amendment 104 Cover Page Interactive Data File (formatted as Inline XBRL) Exhibit Number Description Exhibit Number Description 3.1 Certificate of Amendment 3.1 Certificate of Amendment 104 Cover Page Interactive Data File (formatted as Inline XBRL) 104 Cover Page Interactive Data File (formatted as Inline XBRL) SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

CITIBANK, N.A. was the administrative agent and a lender under the Company's credit facility terminated in connection with entry into the Credit Facility, as described in Item 1.02 of this Current Report. The Credit Facility provides for an unsecured term loan of $250.0 million (the \"Term Loan\") and $750.0 million of ongoing unsecured revolving commitments (the \"Revolver\"), with an option, subject to certain conditions, for the Company to increase the aggregate borrowing capacity by an additional $400.0 million (plus additional unlimited amounts if certain incurrence tests are met) in the future with the Initial Lenders and additional lenders, as required.

The Credit Facility also provides for a sublimit of up to $50.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. All unpaid principal under the Credit Facility will become due and payable on December 1, 2030. Proceeds from the Term Loan and the Revolver on the closing date of the Credit Facility have been used to finance the Refinancing and to pay fees and expenses relating to the Refinancing and relating to the Credit Facility and proceeds from the Revolver after the closing date of the Credit Facility are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, capital investment and working capital needs. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will be deemed, at the Company's election, either: (a) an Alternate Base Rate (\"ABR\") Loan, which bears interest at the ABR, plus a spread of 0.000% to 0.750% based upon net leverage ratios of the Company as set forth in the Credit Facility, or (b) a Term SOFR Loan, which bears interest at Term SOFR (as defined below), plus a spread of 1.000% to 1.750% based upon net leverage ratios of the Company as set forth in the Credit Facility.

Term SOFR is equal to the Term SOFR Screen Rate (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the applicable interest period, with a 0% floor. The Credit Facility does not contain any credit spread adjustment for Term SOFR, which was contained in the Refinanced Credit Agreement. The Company is also obligated under the Credit Facility to pay an unused fee ranging from 0.150% to 0.275% per annum, based upon net leverage ratios of the Company as set forth in the Credit Facility, with respect to any unutilized portion of the Revolver.

(the \"Company\") approved the specific components of, and the payout calibration for, certain awards to be made under the Company's Long Term Incentive Plan (the \"LTI Plan\") for fiscal year 2026. The LTI Plan is a sub-plan consisting of awards made under the Company's 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the \"Omnibus Incentive Plan\"). The participants in the LTI Plan include the Company's currently-serving named executive officers identified in the table below (the \"NEOs\"). The Compensation Committee also approved grants to the NEOs other than the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the \"CEO\"), and the independent members of the Board approved a grant to the CEO, in each case under the LTI Plan for fiscal year 2026 (collectively, the \"FY 2026 LTI Grants\"), consisting of two award components: (1) total shareholder return (\"TSR\") performance shares (50% of the target long-term incentive award value) and (2) time-vesting restricted stock units (50% of the target long-term incentive award value). The performance measure for the TSR performance shares is the absolute TSR of the Company, measured over three performance periods: from November 1, 2025 through October 31, 2026 with respect to 33% of the target number of performance shares (the \"First Performance Period\"); from November 1, 2025 through October 31, 2027 with respect to 33% of the target number of performance shares (the \"Second Performance Period\"); and from November 1, 2025 through October 31, 2028 with respect to 34% of the target number of performance shares (the \"Third Performance Period\" and, together with the First Performance Period and the Second Performance Period, the \"Performance Periods\"). Any performance shares earned based on TSR performance will remain subject to a continued service-based vesting requirement until the third anniversary of the date of grant. TSR performance will be measured by subtracting the beginning stock price of $7.61, representing a 20-trading day average closing price, from the average closing price of the Company's common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the applicable Performance Period, adding any dividends during the period, and then dividing the result by the beginning stock price. The TSR performance goals for each performance period are as follows: First Performance Period Second Performance Period Third Performance Period Threshold (50%) Target (100%) Maximum (235% of Target) Threshold (50%) Target (100%) Maximum (235% of Target) Threshold (50%) Target (100%) Maximum (235% of Target) 20% TSR 35% TSR 50% TSR 20% TSR 35% TSR 50% TSR 20% TSR 35% TSR 50% TSR $9.13 $10.27 $11.42 $10.96 $13.87 $17.12 $13.15 $18.72 $25.68 First Performance Period Second Performance Period Third Performance Period First Performance Period Second Performance Period Third Performance Period Threshold (50%) Target (100%) Maximum (235% of Target) Threshold (50%) Target (100%) Maximum (235% of Target) Threshold (50%) Target (100%) Maximum (235% of Target) Threshold (50%) Target (100%) Maximum (235% of Target) 20% TSR 35% TSR 50% TSR 20% TSR 35% TSR 50% TSR 20% TSR 35% TSR 50% TSR 20% TSR 35% TSR 50% TSR $9.13 $10.27 $11.42 $10.96 $13.87 $17.12 $13.15 $18.72 $25.68 $9.13 $10.27 $11.42 $10.96 $13.87 $17.12 $13.15 $18.72 $25.68 Each award is capped at 235% of the target number of performance shares, and each award is further subject to a stock price cap under which the award will be reduced proportionately if the price of the Company's common stock at the time of payment exceeds a specified dollar amount. The time-vesting restricted stock units granted in fiscal year 2026 will vest at a rate of one-third (1/3) of the total number of restricted stock units on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. None of the FY 2026 LTI Grants include any dividend equivalent or other stockholder rights. The FY 2026 LTI Grants shall, to the extent necessary to avoid issuing shares in excess of the remaining shares reserved for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, be settled in cash. Otherwise, to the extent the awards are earned, they may be settled in shares or cash of an equivalent value. The Form of Performance Share Award Agreement used for the TSR performance shares is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and the Form of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement used for the time-vesting restricted stock units is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.2. The target award values of the FY 2026 LTI Grants to the NEOs are as follows: Named Executive Officer Target 2026 LTI Plan Award Jason Few President and Chief Executive Officer $1,700,000 Michael S.

(\"Citius Oncology\") (Nasdaq: CTOR), the oncology-focused subsidiary of Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Citius Pharma\") (Nasdaq: CTXR), today announced the commercial launch of LYMPHIRTM (denileukin diftitox-cxdl). LYMPHIR is a novel IL-2 receptor-directed fusion protein approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) Stage IIII cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after at least one prior systemic therapy. \"LYMPHIR is an important new treatment option for the CTCL community, and its launch marks the beginning of a new chapter for Citius Oncology. With a median time to response of 1.4 months in the Phase 3 trial, we believe LYMPHIR may offer rapid skin relief, among other benefits, to patients suffering from severe and debilitating itching common with the disease,\" said Leonard Mazur, Chairman and CEO of Citius Oncology and Citius Pharmaceuticals. \"This is our first marketed product and the culmination of years of development work and commercial preparation. LYMPHIR addresses a clear clinical need in a disease with limited treatment options. Ultimately, we expect LYMPHIR to be a meaningful addition to the treatment paradigm for CTCL and a value-driving catalyst for Citius Oncology shareholders. We estimate that LYMPHIR is entering a growing U.S. market valued at over $400 million, with further upside opportunities through international market access and potential expanded indications in the future. Our focus now is on execution to ensure that LYMPHIR reaches the patients who need it,\" added Mazur. The FDA approval of LYMPHIR was based on data from Pivotal Study 302 (NCT01871727), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of LYMPHIR in patients with Stage IIII CTCL who had received at least one prior systemic treatment. The study demonstrated an Objective Response Rate (ORR) of 36.2%, with 84% of evaluable patients experiencing a reduction in skin tumor burden. Moreover, LYMPHIR demonstrated meaningful activity on severe pruritus (itchiness), a significant quality of life issue for CTCL patients. Median time to response was 1.4 months. Importantly, LYMPHIR was not associated with cumulative toxicity. \"LYMPHIR is an important new tool in the fight against CTCL. It is the only FDA-approved systemic therapy for CTCL in more than seven years,\" said Dr. Myron Czuczman, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Citius Oncology and Citius Pharma. \"LYMPHIR's direct tumoricidal activity and transient T-regulatory cell depletion offer a powerful new approach to disease control without cumulative toxicity. As such, LYMPHIR's clinical profile makes it a compelling treatment option for physicians and patients facing the burden of relapsed or refractory CTCL.\" Commercial Access and Distribution LYMPHIR is now available in the U.S. through specialty distributors nationwide. Healthcare providers can access treatment resources and prescribing information via the dedicated portal: www.lymphirhcp.com. The product has been assigned a permanent J-code (J9161), effective April 1, 2025, to facilitate reimbursement and streamline claims processing. The launch is supported by medical education and payer access programs, alongside a field engagement strategy. LYMPHIR has also been included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for CTCL with a Category 2A recommendation. Outside the U.S., Citius Oncology holds exclusive rights to develop and commercialize LYMPHIR in all global markets except India, Japan, and certain parts of Asia. The company recently announced a distribution agreement with Integris Pharma S.A. to initiate named-patient access programs in Greece, Cyprus, and other Southern European and Balkan countries. This partnership marks the first pillar in Citius Oncology's international strategy and supports efforts to provide patients worldwide with access to LYMPHIR. Patient and Provider Resources To support informed treatment decisions and facilitate access to care, Citius Oncology has developed clinical, administrative and educational resources for healthcare providers, available at www.lymphirhcp.com. The site includes prescribing information, reimbursement support materials, and product ordering guidance. Additionally, the site features information about Citius Advantage, a dedicated patient assistance program that includes reimbursement and benefits support, prior authorization assistance, and coordination with specialty pharmacies for eligible patients to help reduce out-of-pocket costs and improve access to treatment. About LYMPHIRTM (denileukin diftitox-cxdl) LYMPHIR is a targeted immune therapy for relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) indicated for use in Stage I-III disease after at least one prior systemic therapy. It is a recombinant fusion protein that combines the IL-2 receptor binding domain with diphtheria toxin (DT) fragments. The agent specifically binds to IL-2 receptors on the cell surface, causing diphtheria toxin fragments that have entered cells to inhibit protein synthesis. After uptake into the cell, the DT fragment is cleaved and the free DT fragments inhibit protein synthesis, resulting in cell death. Denileukin diftitox-cxdl demonstrated the ability to deplete immunosuppressive regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) and antitumor activity through a direct cytocidal action on IL-2R-expressing tumors. In 2021, denileukin diftitox received regulatory approval in Japan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CTCL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Subsequently, in 2021, Citius acquired an exclusive license with rights to develop and commercialize denileukin diftitox in all markets except for India, Japan and certain parts of Asia. LYMPHIR (denileukin diftitox-cxdl) was approved by the FDA in August 2024. About Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a type of cutaneous non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that comes in a variety of forms and is the most common type of cutaneous lymphoma. In CTCL, T-cells, a type of lymphocyte that plays a role in the immune system, become cancerous and develop into skin lesions, leading to a decrease in the quality of life of patients with this disease due to severe pain and pruritus. Mycosis Fungoides (MF) and Szary Syndrome (SS) comprise the majority of CTCL cases. Depending on the type of CTCL, the disease may progress slowly and can take anywhere from several years to upwards of ten to potentially reach tumor stage. However, once the disease reaches this stage, the cancer is highly malignant and can spread to the lymph nodes and internal organs, resulting in a poor prognosis. Given the duration of the disease, patients typically cycle through multiple agents to control disease progression. CTCL affects men twice as often as women and is typically first diagnosed in patients between the ages of 50 and 60 years of age. Other than allogeneic stem cell transplantation, for which only a small fraction of patients qualify, there is currently no curative therapy for advanced CTCL. About Citius Oncology, Inc. Citius Oncology, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTOR) is a platform to develop and commercialize novel targeted oncology therapies. In August 2024, its primary asset, LYMPHIR, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory Stage IIII CTCL who had had at least one prior systemic therapy. Management estimates the initial market for LYMPHIR currently exceeds $400 million, is growing, and is underserved by existing therapies. Robust intellectual property protections that span orphan drug designation, complex technology, trade secrets and pending patents for immuno-oncology use as a combination therapy with checkpoint inhibitors would further support Citius Oncology's competitive positioning.

INDICATION LYMPHIR is an IL2-receptor-directed cytotoxin indicated for the treatment of adult patients with r/r Stage I-III cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) after at least one prior systemic therapy. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION BOXED WARNING: CAPILLARY LEAK SYNDROME Capillary leak syndrome (CLS), including life-threatening or fatal reactions, can occur in patients receiving LYMPHIR. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CLS during treatment. Withhold LYMPHIR until CLS resolves, or permanently discontinue based on severity. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Capillary Leak Syndrome LYMPHIR can cause capillary leak syndrome (CLS), including life-threatening or fatal reactions. CLS was defined in the clinical trials as the occurrence of at least 2 of the following symptoms at any time during LYMPHIR therapy: hypotension, edema, and serum albumin <3 g/dL. These symptoms were not required to occur simultaneously to be characterized as capillary leak syndrome. As defined, CLS occurred in 27% of patients in the pooled population across 3 clinical trials, including 8% with Grade 3. There was one (0.8%) fatal occurrence of CLS. Of the patients with CLS, 22% had recurrence. The majority of CLS events (81%) occurred within the first 2 cycles of treatment. The median time to onset from Cycle 1, Day 1 was 6.5 days (range: 1 to 77), the median duration of CLS was 14 days (range: 2 to 40), and 75% of patients had resolution. The most common symptoms included edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hypotension. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and dehydration also occurred. Regularly assess patients for weight gain, new onset or worsening of edema, dyspnea, and hypotension (including orthostatic changes). Monitor serum albumin levels prior to the initiation of each cycle of therapy and more often as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity. If LYMPHIR is withheld, resume LYMPHIR following resolution of CLS and when serum albumin is greater than or equal to 3 g/dL. Visual Impairment LYMPHIR can cause serious visual impairment, including changes in visual acuity and color vision. In the pooled population across 3 clinical trials, visual impairment occurred in 9%, with Grade 1 in 8% and Grade 2 in 1%. The most commonly reported symptom was blurred vision. Of the patients with visual impairment, 67% had resolution of their visual impairment. Perform baseline ophthalmic examination and monitor as clinically indicated. If patients experience symptoms of visual impairment, such as changes in visual acuity, changes in color vision, or blurred vision, refer for ophthalmologic evaluation. Withhold LYMPHIR until visual impairment resolves or permanently discontinue based on severity. Infusion-Related Reactions LYMPHIR can cause serious infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions were reported in 69% of patients in the pooled population across 3 clinical trials of patients who received LYMPHIR, with Grade 3 infusion-related reactions in 3.4%. Eighty-three percent of infusion-related reactions occurred in Cycles 1 and 2. The most common symptoms included nausea, fatigue, chills, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, fever, and arthralgia. Premedicate patients for the first three cycles prior to starting a LYMPHIR infusion. Monitor patients frequently during infusion. For Grade 2 or higher infusion reactions, premedicate at least 30 minutes prior to each subsequent infusion with a systemic steroid for at least 3 cycles. Interrupt or discontinue LYMPHIR based on severity. Institute appropriate medical management. Hepatotoxicity LYMPHIR can cause hepatotoxicity. In the pooled safety population, elevated ALT occurred in 70% of patients, with Grade 3 ALT occurring in 22%; elevated AST occurred in 64% of patients, with Grade 3 AST elevation occurring in 9%. For Grade 3 events, median time to onset was 8 days (range: 1 to 15 days); median time to resolution was 15 days (range: 7 to 50 days); all cases of Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations resolved. Elevated total bilirubin occurred in 5% of patients, with Grade 3 occurring in 0.9%. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue LYMPHIR based on severity. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, LYMPHIR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of LYMPHIR. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 days following the last dose of LYMPHIR. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (20%), including laboratory abnormalities, are increased transaminases, albumin decreased, nausea, edema, hemoglobin decreased, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, chills, constipation, pyrexia, and capillary leak syndrome. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action, LYMPHIR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on the use of LYMPHIR in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk. No animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with denileukin diftitox. Denileukin diftitox-cxdl causes depletion of regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg), immune activation, and capillary leak syndrome, compromising pregnancy maintenance. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of denileukin diftitox-cxdl in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with LYMPHIR and for 7 days after the last dose. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action, LYMPHIR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LYMPHIR. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LYMPHIR and for 7 days after the last dose. Infertility Males Based on findings in rats, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with LYMPHIR. The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of LYMPHIR in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Of the 69 patients with Stage I-III r/r CTCL who received LYMPHIR, 34 patients (49%) were 65 years of age and older and 10 patients (14%) were 75 years of age and older. Clinical studies of LYMPHIR did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients.

Billed revenue per day has not been adjusted for the portion of revenue deferred for financial statement purposes. In November 2025, Asset-Based daily shipments and tonnage increased compared to the same period last year, while weight per shipment remained flat. Revenue per hundredweight, both including and excluding fuel, declined by approximately 2%. The pricing environment continues to be rational. Sequentially, from October to November, shipments per day increased approximately 3% and weight per shipment increased 5%, which resulted in a tonnage per day increase of 8%. Revenue per hundredweight including fuel was down 4% and excluding fuel was down 5%. Historically, ABF's non-GAAP operating ratio has deteriorated by roughly 100 to 200 basis points from the third to the fourth quarter. For the current quarter, we anticipate a sequential deterioration of about 400 basis points, driven by continued softness in the broader freight market and the impact of three fewer workdays compared to the third quarter.

Shipment growth during the month was supported by continued strength in our Managed solution. On a sequential basis, from October to November, daily revenue and shipments both increased 12%, and revenue per shipment was flat. Considering seasonality and current market dynamics, we expect a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $1 million to $3 million for the fourth quarter of 2025. This estimate excludes GAAP impacts from changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, which we currently estimate at zero, and purchase accounting amortization, which we anticipate will total approximately $3 million for the quarter.

The Stock Split Amendment, effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 1, 2025 (the \"Effective Time\"), combined every seven issued and outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company into one share of common stock, $0.07 par value per share, of the Company. Pursuant to the Stock Split Amendment, any fraction of a share of common stock that would otherwise have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split will be settled by cash payment, calculated based on the per share closing price of the Company's common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") on December 1, 2025. The Reverse Stock Split decreased the number of outstanding shares of common stock of the Company to approximately 54,217,407 from 379,521,855 (before giving effect to any fractional shares to be paid out in cash). Immediately following the Effective Time, (i) the Par Value Amendment took effect to proportionally decrease the par value of the Company's common stock immediately following the Reverse Stock Split from $0.07 per share back to $0.01 per share and (ii) the Authorized Shares Amendment took effect to proportionally decrease the number of authorized shares following the Reverse Stock Split from 740,800,000 shares of stock (consisting of 722,400,000 shares of common stock and 18,400,000 shares of preferred stock) to 121,600,000 shares of stock (consisting of 103,200,000 shares of common stock and 18,400,000 shares of preferred stock). The Company's common stock is expected to begin trading on the NYSE on a split-adjusted basis at market open on December 2, 2025. Trading in the common stock will continue on the NYSE under the symbol \"HPP\" under the new CUSIP number: 444097406. The Reverse Stock Split affected all record holders of the Company's common stock uniformly and did not affect any record holder's percentage ownership interest in the Company, except for de minimis changes as a result of the elimination of fractional shares. Holders of common stock who hold in \"street name\" in their brokerage accounts do not have to take any action as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Their accounts will be automatically adjusted to reflect the number of shares owned. A letter of transmittal relating to the Reverse Stock Split will be sent to record holders of certificates of common stock within twenty days of the Effective Time. Stockholders who receive this letter of transmittal should follow the instructions in that letter. The foregoing description of the Articles of Amendment is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the complete text of the Articles of Amendment, which are filed as Exhibits 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and incorporated by reference into this Item 5.03. Partnership Agreement Amendment On December 1, 2025, the Company, as general partner of Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P., its operating partnership subsidiary (the \"Operating Partnership\"), executed the Sixth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P.

On November 25, 2025, Ovintiv Inc.

The Term Credit Agreement provides for a two-year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.2 billion (the \"Term Loan Facility\") to be funded on the date (the \"Funding Date\") on which certain conditions, including the substantially concurrent consummation of the NuVista Acquisition (defined below), have been satisfied or waived by the requisite lenders under the Term Credit Agreement. The Term Loan Facility is intended to finance the previously announced acquisition by Ovintiv Canada of all the issued and outstanding common shares of NuVista Energy Ltd. not already owned by Ovintiv Canada (the \"NuVista Acquisition\"). Two-Year two-year The Term Loan Facility is scheduled to mature on the second anniversary of the Funding Date. The Term Loan Facility bears interest, at Ovintiv Canada's option, at (i) Base Rate or Canadian Prime Rate (each as defined in the Term Credit Agreement), as applicable, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.0 basis points to 100.0 basis points, depending on Ovintiv's credit ratings, or (ii) Term SOFR or Adjusted Term CORRA (each as defined in the Term Credit Agreement), as applicable, plus an applicable margin ranging from 100.0 basis points to 200.0 basis points, depending on Ovintiv's credit ratings. Ovintiv Canada's obligations under the Term Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Ovintiv. The Term Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that Ovintiv considers customary for an agreement of that type, including a covenant that requires Ovintiv's ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (expressed as a percentage) not to exceed 60% as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. Under the Term Credit Agreement, if an event of default exists, the lenders holding (a) prior to the funding of the loans under the Term Loan Facility on the Funding Date, more than 50% of the commitments under the Term Credit Agreement and (b) on and after the funding of the loans under the Term Loan Facility on the Funding Date, more than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of all the loans outstanding under the Term Credit Agreement, may terminate all of the commitments under the Term Credit Agreement and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement. One or more lenders party to the Term Credit Agreement have in the past performed, and may in the future, from time to time, perform investment banking, financial advisory, lending or commercial banking services for Ovintiv and its subsidiaries, for which they have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation and reimbursement of expenses.

(NASDAQ: CYCU) (\"Cycurion\") and IQSTEL Inc. (NASDAQ: IQST) (\"IQSTEL\") refer to the joint press release dated September 3, 2025, in which each company announced plans to distribute $500,000 worth of the other company's shares to its respective shareholders. To further solidify the strategic alliance between the two companies, IQSTEL and Cycurion today announce an updated approach: Each company will instead distribute $500,000 worth of its own shares as a one-time, pro-rata dividend to its own respective shareholders, while preserving the full $1,000,000 in cross-ownership shares. Following a coordinated review, Cycurion and IQSTEL agreed that issuing dividends in their own sharesrather than redistributing cross-held sharesprovides a more streamlined, efficient, and value-enhancing structure for shareholders. The original cross-shareholding swap is expected to proceed next year once the shares meet seasoning requirements. A Clear Signal of Long-Term Investment and Joint Growth keeping the full cross-holding positions intact , Cycurion and IQSTEL reinforce to the market that their relationship is not transactional, but rather a long-term investment commitment , reflecting a shared strategy, joint product development roadmap, and tightly aligned corporate vision. Both companies described the decision as a strong symbol of their status as \"sibling companies,\" working collaboratively to expand their technological footprint in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, telecom, and high-tech enterprise services. Maintaining Cross-Holdings Strengthens Market Confidence Cycurion CEO Kevin Kelly said: \"Keeping the cross-holdings untouched sends the right message: our companies are growing side by side. The dividend distribution using each company's own shares eliminates unnecessary regulatory filings, streamlines the process for shareholders, and preserves the strength of our strategic alliance.\" IQSTEL CEO Leandro Iglesias commented: \"By retaining the full $1,000,000 in shares of each other, IQSTEL and Cycurion demonstrate a deeper level of trust and alignment. This is a long-term partnership. We are building high-tech products together, entering new markets together, and showing shareholders that we are mutually invested in each other's future.\" A Foundation for Joint Developments Ahead IQSTEL and Cycurion are currently co-developing advanced cybersecurity technologies, AI-based threat intelligence applications, and identity-driven security solutions aimed at telecom operators, financial institutions, and enterprise clients across more than 20 countries and 17 time zones.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Ingevity has presented certain financial measures, defined below, which have not been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and has provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP on the following pages. These financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors should consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide management as well as investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of the business, because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance, liquidity measures, and projected future results.

Total adjusted earnings (loss) is defined as Adjusted earnings (loss) from continuing operations and Adjusted earnings (loss) from discontinued operations. Diluted adjusted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share is defined as diluted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share plus restructuring and other (income) charges, net, per share, goodwill impairment charges per share, acquisition and other-related (income) costs per share, pension and postretirement settlement and curtailment (income) charges per share, (gain) loss on strategic investments per share, debt refinancing fees per share, litigation verdict charge per share, proxy contest charges per share, portfolio review expenses per share, and the income tax expense (benefit) per share on those items, less the provision (benefit) from certain discrete tax items per share. Page 1 Diluted adjusted earnings (loss) from discontinued operations per share is defined as diluted earnings (loss) from discontinued operations per share plus restructuring and other (income) charges, net, per share, goodwill impairment charges per share, acquisition and other-related (income) costs per share, loss on CTO resales per share, CTO supply contract termination charges per share, (gain) loss on strategic investments per share, and the income tax expense (benefit) per share on those items, less the provision (benefit) from certain discrete tax items per share. Total diluted adjusted earnings (loss) per share is defined as diluted adjusted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share and diluted adjusted earnings (loss) from discontinued operations per share.

Net Debt Ratio is defined as Net Debt divided by the last twelve months Total Adjusted EBITDA. Ingevity's management also uses the above financial measures as the primary measures of profitability and liquidity of the business.

Securities Purchase Agreement On November 26, 2025, Upexi, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\"), entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with a certain institutional investor (the \"Purchaser\") pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and issue to the Purchaser in a private placement offering (the \"Offering\"): (i) 3,289,474 shares of common stock (the \"Shares\"), par value $0.00001 per share (the \"Common Stock\"), and (ii) common stock purchase warrants (the \"Warrants\") to purchase up to 3,289,474 shares of Common Stock (the \"Warrant Shares\") for an aggregate purchase price of $10,000,000, representing a purchase price of $3.04 per share of Common Stock and accompanying Warrant. Each Warrant is exercisable for one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $4.00 per Warrant Share. The Warrants are immediately exercisable, and may be exercised at any time until all of the Warrants issued in the Offering are exercised in full. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for working capital, general corporate purposes and internally managed, Solana (SOL) maximum return strategy. A.G.P/Alliance Global Partners (\"A.G.P\" or the \"Placement Agent\") acted as the sole placement agent in connection with the Offering. The Shares and the Warrants were offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and applicable state securities laws. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, for a period of 15 days after the effective date of the Resale Registration Statement (as defined below), the Company agreed not to (i) issue, enter into any agreement to issue, or announce the issuance or proposed issuance of any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents, excluding any agreement related to an equity line of credit where the Placement Agent shall act as placement agent for such equity line (the \"ELOC\") or (ii) file any registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, subject to certain customary exceptions, without the consent of the Purchaser and A.G.P. However, the Company shall be permitted to file (i) a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to a shareholder approved equity incentive plan, (ii) a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, (iii) the Resale Registration Statement, and (iv) any registration statement or prospectus supplement related the ELOC. Additionally, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to file a registration statement (the \"Resale Registration Statement\") providing for the resale of the Shares and the Warrant Shares within 5 calendar days of the date of the Purchase Agreement, to have the Resale Registration Statement declared effective within 30 days following the filing date (or 60 days, if the Securities and Exchange Commission conducts a full review), and to maintain the effectiveness of the Resale Registration Statement until the Purchaser owns no Warrants or Warrant Shares. The closing of the Offering occurred on December 1, 2025. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $10 million from the Offering and may receive up to an additional $13 million upon the cash exercise of the Warrants, if any, before deducting Placement Agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. Placement Agency Agreement The Company also entered into a Placement Agency Agreement (the \"Placement Agency Agreement\") with A.G.P., dated November 26, 2025, pursuant to which A.G.P agreed to serve as the exclusive placement agent for the Company in connection with the Offering.

The Company also agreed to pay A.G.P. a cash fee of 5.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised from the exercise of the Warrants, if any. In addition, the Company agreed to reimburse A.G.P for up to $75,000 of its legal fees and other out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the Offering, as well as non-accountable expenses incurred by A.G.P for up to $25,000 in connection with the Offering.

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 15 shares of Mesa common stock issued and outstanding on the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split was consolidated into one issued and outstanding share of Mesa common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and instead, any fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share at the registered holder and participant level with The Depository Trust Company. Additionally, proportionate adjustments were made to the number of shares of Mesa common stock underlying outstanding equity awards. Certificate of Change The Reverse Stock Split affected all stockholders of Mesa uniformly and did not alter any stockholder's percentage interest in Mesa's equity (other than as a result of the rounding of shares to the nearest whole share in lieu of issuing fractional shares).

Fourth Quarter 2025 Results Revenue of $712 million Operating Income of $18 million Net Loss of $13 million, or $(0.10) per diluted share Adjusted Net Income* of $4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA* of $65 million Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities of $31 million and Free Cash Flow* of $16 million Available liquidity of $298 million including $30 million cash and cash equivalents on hand Management Commentary \"We ended fiscal 2025 in a good position to advance our strategic priorities as we enter fiscal 2026,\" said Jim Barber, President and CEO. \"Over the past several months, we have taken a close look at our commercial strategy as well as our operations and identified the actions needed to strengthen performance, unlock operating leverage, and better serve our customers. As a result, we have launched a comprehensive business transformation plan anchored on three strategic pillars: Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence, and Asset & Network Optimization. We have already begun executing initiatives under the plan, and we anticipate these improvements will be progressively realized throughout fiscal 2026 as we advance our multi-year transformation,\" Mr. Barber concluded. \"As we look ahead, our near-term focus is increasing both profitability and cash flow to lay the foundation for stronger, more durable financial performance going forward,\" said Kelly Janzen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"The variety of initiatives we are executing related to our value-creation plan represents a critical step toward improving operating leverage, supporting the balance sheet and unlocking the full potential of our platform to deliver lasting value for all stakeholders. The plan is expected to generate annual operating cost savings of at least $75 million by the end of fiscal 2026 and to also enhance revenue.\" Strategic Business Transformation Today, the Company announced the launch of a formal multi-year strategic transformational restructuring plan (the \"Plan\") designed to make the Company more customer focused, agile and efficient while positioning it for long-term profitable growth. Developed in collaboration with leading third-party advisors, the Plan is structured around three strategic priorities: Commercial Excellence, Operational Excellence and Asset & Network Optimization. ____________________________________ * A non-GAAP measure, see accompanying non-GAAP measure explanations and reconciliations later in this release Commercial Excellence: Enhancing customer retention, penetration and profitability through improved segmentation, strategic pricing, expanded product offerings and disciplined commercial execution. Operational Excellence: Standardizing operations across facilities to boost efficiency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, streamlining our organizational structure to align resources with strategic goals while modernizing core processes and systems. Asset & Network Optimization: Improving logistics and asset utilization through network rationalization, equipment reallocation, and targeted capital investments. These priorities establish a clear framework for near-term performance improvement and long-term value creation through disciplined execution, continuous improvement, and a relentless focus on serving customers. We expect the Plan to be substantially complete by the end of 2027 and we estimate that costs related to the execution of the Plan will be in the range of approximately $25 million to $30 million. Fourth Quarter 2025 Financial Performance Revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter totaled $712.0 million, an increase of $27.7 million year over year or 4.1%. The increase in revenue compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of an additional week, which increased revenue by $51.6 million. Excluding the impact of the additional week, revenue declined 3.5% year over year, reflecting an $18.1 million decrease in rental revenue, due primarily to the net impact of lost business, a $5.0 million decline in direct sales revenue and a $0.8 million negative impact of foreign exchange on currency related to our Canadian business. Operating income for the fiscal fourth quarter was $17.6 million, compared to $29.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of $12.2 million. The decrease year over year is primarily attributable to margin related to the net impact of lost business offset by selling, general and administrative cost improvements, and a small benefit from an additional week of operations. ____________________________________ * A non-GAAP measure, see accompanying non-GAAP measure explanations and reconciliations later in this release Capital Allocation and Financial Position During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025, we invested $15.4 million in property and equipment, the majority of which was related to market center facility improvements. Net cash provided by operating activities was $30.9 million and Free Cash Flow* was $15.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2025. Excluding a $233 million favorable impact to operating cash flow associated with the initial trade receivables sold under the Accounts Receivable Securitization facility in the fourth quarter of 2024, operating cash flow decreased $31.7 million and Free Cash Flow* decreased $18.9 million , respectively, from the comparative prior year period. The decrease in Free Cash Flow* primarily reflects the decrease in earnings year over year, partially offset by a $12.8 million reduction in investments in property and equipment. As of October 3, 2025, Vestis had total cash and excess availability under its revolving credit facility of $298 million as compared to $326 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. Total debt outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.34 billion including principal bank debt outstanding of $1.17 billion. Fiscal Year 2026 Outlook The Company expects fiscal 2026 revenue to be between flat to down 2% as compared to normalized fiscal 2025 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA* to be in the range of $285 million and $315 million. Additionally, the Company expects fiscal 2026 Free Cash Flow* to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. ____________________________________ * A non-GAAP measure, see accompanying non-GAAP measure explanations and reconciliations later in this release Fourth Quarter & Full-Year 2025 Results Conference Call & Webcast Vestis will host a conference call on Tuesday, December 2, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2025 results.

Vestis believes that non-GAAP financial measures, both together with and in addition to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measure, are important supplemental measures that exclude non-cash or other items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to Vestis' core operating results. Vestis uses these non-GAAP financial measures with U.S. GAAP financial measures and other comparable tools to assist in the evaluation of its operating performance. Vestis believes that presentation of these measures also helps investors because the measures enable better comparisons of Vestis' historical results and allow investors to evaluate Vestis' performance based on the same metrics that Vestis uses to evaluate its performance and trends in its results. However, these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Vestis' results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Specifically, you should not consider these measures as alternatives to revenue, operating income, operating income margin, net income, net income margin or net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures also should not be considered as measures of cash available to Vestis to invest in the growth of Vestis' business or cash that will be available to Vestis to meet its obligations. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented by Vestis may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies because not all companies use identical calculations. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the tables at the end of this presentation.

Overland Park, KS and New York, NY, Dec. 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Precision Aerospace & Defense Group, Inc., a high-growth aerospace & defense engineering and manufacturing firm, and FACT II Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: FACT), a special purpose acquisition company, today announced that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement. Upon closing of the proposed business combination, the combined company will operate under the name Precision Aerospace & Defense Group, Inc. The transaction implies an enterprise value of up to $320 million for PAD (assuming a $10.00 per share price and after giving effect to certain pending acquisitions). It is expected that the combined company will continue to be led by PAD's existing management team, with Brent Borden remaining as Chief Executive Officer. PAD's Platform PAD has rapidly expanded via strategic acquisitions into a robust multi-platform business delivering mission-critical products and services across the aerospace, defense, and space sectors. PAD operates through three complementary divisions engineering & sustainment, precision manufacturing, and advanced non-destructive testing each possessing deep technical expertise and specialized certifications in support of critical programs. PAD's engineering & sustainment unit provides custom design, reverse engineering, and MRO solutions to extend the life of legacy military aircraft and systems. Its precision manufacturing division efficiently produces complex aerospace and defense components to exacting specifications, leveraging advanced CNC machining and assembly capabilities. PAD's advanced non-destructive testing division offers specialized testing services and equipment to ensure the structural integrity of high-performance aerospace parts. This diversified suite of capabilities has historically made PAD a trusted partner to blue-chip defense contractors, OEMs, and U.S. government organizations, supported by multi-year contracts and a proven track record of quality and on-time delivery. PAD's solutions play a mission-critical role in arenas ranging from military fleet sustainment and next-generation hypersonic flight systems to commercial aviation fleets and cutting-edge space launch infrastructure. PAD operates multiple AS9100-certified and ITAR-registered facilities across the United States, reflecting its commitment to rigorous quality standards and compliance with defense regulations. In addition, PAD intends to continue to execute on its accretive, programmatic acquisition strategy, adding highly specialized capabilities across its platform enabling it to provide a full suite of service solutions to its existing and pipeline customer base. There can be no assurance that any planned acquisitions will be completed. Brent Borden, Chief Executive Officer of PAD, commented: \"Today marks a pivotal milestone for PAD. This proposed business combination with FACT and our transition to a public company will provide significant growth capital and is a strong validation of the business we have built. Over the past few years, we have assembled a world-class engineering, manufacturing, and testing platform to address the most demanding needs of the aerospace, defense, and space industries. Our team's relentless focus on innovation, quality, and execution has strategically positioned PAD with respect to key industry trends from military fleet sustainment to the new space economy. We are thrilled to partner with FACT on this next chapter. We expect that the anticipated proceeds from and in connection with this transaction will allow us to accelerate product development, invest in cutting-edge equipment, and pursue strategic acquisitions already identified in our pipeline. Most importantly, it ensures we can continue to deliver exceptional value and performance to our customers and stakeholders. I am incredibly proud of what our employees have achieved to date, and I'm confident that as a public company, PAD will be even better positioned to drive innovation and growth in our sector.\" Adam Gishen, Chief Executive Officer of FACT, noted: \"Our goal at FACT was to identify a high-quality, visionary company with strong fundamentals and an excellent management team and we have found that in Precision Aerospace & Defense Group, Inc. Brent and his team have built an impressive platform with strategic end-to-end capabilities that meet the demands of their customers and the industry. PAD's strategic positioning at the nexus of aerospace and defense modernization (including the increasing demand for efficiency and the burgeoning space sector) truly sets it apart. With a blue-chip customer base and multi-year contracts, PAD offers both stability and exciting growth prospects, coupled with strong free cash generation from operations. We believe PAD is poised for sustained expansion and value creation, and we are excited to partner with them to bring this outstanding business to the public markets. We look forward to working closely with the PAD team to support their strategic vision.\" Key Transaction Terms and Structure Under the business combination agreement, PAD's implied enterprise value is up to $320 million (at a $10.00 per share reference price and after giving effect to certain pending acquisitions). Key terms of the business combination include: Capital & Financing: In connection with the proposed business combination, PAD has entered into a non-binding indicative term sheet with BC Partners relating to a potential credit facility and equity financing of up to an anticipated aggregate amount of $80 million (the \"Financing\"). The Financing is subject to numerous conditions, including, without limitation, the completion of due diligence and the execution and delivery of definitive documentation. We anticipate that the Financing, together with the funds in FACT's trust account (consisting of approximately $175 million in gross proceeds raised in FACT's initial public offering, subject to any redemptions), would provide funding to strengthen PAD's balance sheet, finance strategic acquisitions, and support ongoing growth. In addition, the parties may seek other sources of financing in connection with the business combination and to bolster PAD's balance sheet and fund future growth initiatives. There can be no assurance that any definitive agreement will be entered into in relation to the Financing or that the Financing or any other financing will be completed on the terms described, or at all. Incoming Capital: Incoming capital would permit PAD to optimize its balance sheet, consummate existing planned acquisitions and fund its future acquisition pipeline. Any additional cash to PAD's balance sheet is expected to be used for general corporate purposes, positioning the combined company for robust growth post-closing. There can be no assurance that any planned acquisitions will be completed or additional funding will be consummated. Forma Ownership Structure: Following the business combination, PAD's current shareholders are expected to own approximately 59% of the combined company's outstanding shares. Governance and Leadership: We anticipate that the combined company's board of directors will include, among others, certain current directors of PAD, one designee by FACT's sponsor, and independent directors with relevant industry experience. The combined company will remain headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, and PAD's seasoned executive team will continue to lead day-to-day operations.

On December 1, 2025, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors approved the rescission and cancellation, in their entirety and effective immediately, of the shares of restricted Common Stock previously granted to the CEO and each Director on November 12, 2025. In addition, on December 1, 2025, the CEO and each Director entered into a Restricted Stock Award Rescission Agreement (each a \"Rescission Agreement\") with the Company pursuant to which each of them acknowledged and agreed to the rescission and cancellation of the Awards. No consideration was paid in connection with these rescissions, and all such awards have been cancelled. The Company expects that the CEO and each Director will file an updated Form 4 pursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The previously disclosed grant made to John Saunders, who was appointed as Chief Financial Officer of the Company on November 12, 2025 is unaffected.

(\"Valvoline\") entered into an Incremental Amendment (the \"Amendment\") among Valvoline, certain subsidiaries of Valvoline party thereto as guarantors, The Bank of Nova Scotia, as administrative agent (in such capacity, the \"Administrative Agent\"), and the lenders party thereto, which Amendment amended that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of July 11, 2016 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement, dated as of September 21, 2016, as supplemented by the Valvoline Joinder Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2016, as amended and restated by the Amendment and Restatement Agreement, dated as of April 12, 2019, as amended by Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement, dated as of November 10, 2022, and as further amended and restated effective as of March 1, 2023 pursuant to that certain Amendment and Restatement Agreement, dated as of December 12, 2022), among Valvoline (as successor in interest to Valvoline Finco One LLC), The Bank of Nova Scotia, as the Administrative Agent, the swing line lender and a letter of credit issuer, and the lenders and other letter of credit issuers party thereto (the \"Original Credit Agreement\", and as amended by the Amendment, the \"Amended Credit Agreement\"). The Amendment, among other things, provides for the establishment of a new $740 million incremental senior secured term loan B credit facility (the \"Incremental Term Facility\"), which was made available in a single drawing on the Closing Date, and which has a maturity date of the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date. Under the terms of the Amendment, the Incremental Term Facility lenders party thereto agreed to fund the Incremental Term Facility substantially simultaneously with, and conditioned upon, the consummation of the Acquisition (as defined below). The proceeds of borrowing under the Incremental Term Facility will be used for, among other purposes, (i) paying the cash consideration for the Acquisition (including payment of related fees, premiums, expenses, and other related transaction costs) on the Closing Date and (ii) repaying outstanding amounts under the existing revolving credit facility under the Original Credit Agreement. The effectiveness of the Amendment and the funding of the Incremental Term Facility on the Closing Date were subject to certain conditions precedent, including (i) the consummation of the Acquisition, (ii) the delivery of certain certificates, organizational documents and legal opinions, (iii) the delivery of a request for credit extension, and (iv) certain other documentary and non-documentary conditions set forth in the Amendment. The Incremental Term Facility will continue to be guaranteed by Valvoline's existing and future subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, joint ventures, special purpose financing subsidiaries, regulated subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and certain other excluded subsidiaries), and will continue to be secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all the personal property of Valvoline and the guarantors, including all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of Valvoline's and the guarantors' domestic subsidiaries and first-tier foreign subsidiaries and, in certain cases, a portion of the equity interests of other foreign subsidiaries. At Valvoline's option, the term loans issued under the Incremental Term Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum based on either the then-prevailing adjusted term SOFR rate or an alternate base rate, in each case, plus the applicable interest rate margin. In the case of term SOFR loans, Valvoline may select interest periods of one, three or six months and, upon approval of all lenders under the Incremental Term Facility, twelve months or such shorter period as is requested by Valvoline and approved by all lenders under the Incremental Term Facility. Term loans under the Incremental Term Facility will bear interest at adjusted term SOFR plus 2.000% per annum, in the case of term SOFR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 1.000%, in the case of alternate base rate borrowings. The Incremental Term Facility may be prepaid at any time and from time to time in whole or in part without premium (other than a 1.0% prepayment premium on principal prepaid in a repricing event occurring during the six-month period immediately following the Closing Date) or penalty (but subject to reimbursement for any break funding losses with respect to term SOFR borrowings). Valvoline must prepay the Incremental Term Facility (in the case of the following clause (i), on a ratable basis with the existing term A facility outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement) with (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds (x) obtained by Valvoline or any of its subsidiaries from certain asset dispositions (subject to certain reinvestment rights), (y) as a result of the occurrence of a casualty event (subject to certain reinvestment rights), or (z) from the incurrence or issuance by Valvoline or any of its subsidiaries of any indebtedness that is not permitted under the Amended Credit Agreement or of any refinancing debt, in each case, subject to the reinvestment rights and other terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement, and (ii) a certain percentage of its excess cash flow as calculated under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Incremental Term Facility will amortize at a rate of 0.25% per fiscal quarter after the funding on the Closing Date (payable in equal quarterly installments, commencing with the last day of the first full fiscal quarter following the Closing Date, and 2 which amounts shall be reduced as a result of the application of any voluntary or mandatory prepayments made by Valvoline pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement), with the full outstanding balance of the Incremental Term Facility to be paid on the final maturity date. The final maturity date of the Incremental Term Facility is the date that is the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date. The Amended Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations and warranties, and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on liens, additional indebtedness, investments, restricted payments, asset sales, mergers, affiliate transactions and other customary limitations, as well as financial covenants (including maintenance of a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio) and other customary limitations. The Amended Credit Agreement also contains usual and customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest, fees and other amounts, material breach of a representation or warranty, non-performance of covenants and other obligations, default on other material debt, bankruptcy or insolvency, material judgments, incurrence of certain material ERISA liabilities, invalidity of loan documentation, impairment of the collateral, and change of control.

On November 24, 2025 (the \"Closing Date\") Ducommun Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (\"Ducommun\") and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement, Security Agreement and Pledge Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swingline lender and an L/C issuer, and the lender parties thereto (the \"Amendment\"). The Amendment, among other things, made certain amendments to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of July 14, 2022 (the \"Existing Credit Agreement\" and as amended by the Amendment, the \"Amended Credit Agreement\") among Ducommun, certain subsidiaries of Ducommun party thereto, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swingline lender and an L/C issuer. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for (i) a five-year $200 million senior secured term loan facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\"), all of which was drawn on the Closing Date and (ii) a five-year $450 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\" and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the \"Facilities\"), of which $120 million was drawn on the Closing Date. The Revolving Credit Facility includes a $30 million sublimit for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit and a $15 million swingline subfacility. Ducommun used the proceeds of the borrowings made on the Closing Date under the Revolving Credit Facility to prepay a portion of the outstanding term loan and accrued and unpaid interest thereon under the Existing Credit Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses. Additionally, Ducommun intends to use the proceeds to fund working capital and for other general corporate expenses. Ducommun has the option to request the addition of one or more incremental term loan facilities or the increase of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by (i) up to the greater of (a) $125 million and (b) 100% of consolidated EBITDA for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters plus (ii) such amounts as would not cause the consolidated first lien net adjusted leverage ratio, determined on a pro forma basis after giving effect to any such additions and increases, to exceed 4.00:1.00, which additions and increases are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. The initial variable interest rate on amounts outstanding under the Facilities will be Term SOFR plus 1.50%, subject to adjustments based on Ducommun's consolidated total net adjusted leverage ratio. Ducommun's obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and any hedging or cash management obligations entered into by Ducommun or any of its current and future material domestic restricted subsidiaries (the \"Subsidiary Guarantors\" and, together with Ducommun, the \"Loan Parties\") with a lender under the Amended Credit Agreement or an affiliate of such lender are guaranteed by Ducommun and each such Subsidiary Guarantor. Ducommun's and the Subsidiary Guarantors' obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of their assets, subject to certain customary exceptions. Ducommun is required to make payments of amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement (without payment of a premium or penalty) with (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds received from certain non-ordinary course asset sales, dispositions and extraordinary proceeds in excess of agreed upon thresholds, subject to certain reinvestment rights and repatriation issues and (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds received by Ducommun or any of its restricted subsidiaries from the issuance of any indebtedness (other than indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Amended Credit Agreement). The loans under the Term Loan Facility will amortize in quarterly installments, equal to 2.50% per annum of the original aggregate principal amount thereof during the first two years, 5.00% per annum of the original aggregate principal amount thereof during the next two years and 7.50% per annum of the original aggregate principal amount thereof during the final year with the remaining balance payable on November 24, 2030. The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are due on November 24, 2030. non-ordinary The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Loan Parties and the restricted subsidiaries of Ducommun, including, without limitation, restrictions on liens, indebtedness, investments, fundamental changes, dispositions, restricted payments and prepayment of junior indebtedness. The Amended Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require the Loan Parties and restricted subsidiaries of Ducommun to (i) not exceed a maximum consolidated total net adjusted leverage ratio initially set at 4.75:1.00, which, at Ducommun's option, may increase up to 5.25:1.00 for certain permitted acquisitions and (ii) maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 2.00:1.00. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, covenant defaults, breaches of certain representations and warranties, cross defaults to certain material indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, certain events under ERISA, material judgments and change of control. If an event of default occurs and is not cured within any applicable grace period or is not waived, the administrative agent and the lenders are entitled to take various actions, including, without limitation, the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and termination of commitments under the Facilities.

Accordingly, the Company continues to expect the following full-year 2025 ranges: Net operating revenue of $5,905 million to $5,955 million; Net operating revenue of $5,905 million to $5,955 million; Adjusted EBITDA of $1,235 million to $1,255 million; and Adjusted EBITDA of $1,235 million to $1,255 million; and Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Encompass Health of $5.22 to $5.37.

The furnishing of this information will not be deemed an admission as to the materiality of any information contained herein. Note Regarding Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Excluding net operating revenues, the Company does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because it is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future impact of items that are deemed to be outside the control of the Company or otherwise not indicative of its ongoing operating performance. Such items include government, class action, and related settlements; professional feesaccounting, tax, and legal; mark-to-market adjustments for stock appreciation rights; gains or losses related to hedging instruments; loss on early extinguishment of debt; adjustments to its income tax provision (such as valuation allowance adjustments and settlements of income tax claims); items related to corporate and facility restructurings; and certain other items the Company believes to be not indicative of its ongoing operations. These items cannot be reasonably predicted and will depend on several factors, including industry and market conditions, and could be material to the Company's results computed in accordance with GAAP.

(NYSE: OGS) today issued financial guidance for 2026 and updated its five-year growth rates, including raising its long-term diluted earnings per share growth rate to 5% to 7%, from 4% to 6% previously. \"As we enter 2026, we are fully leveraging opportunities to support customer growth and invest in our system, all while maintaining our commitments to safety and customer affordability,\" said Robert S. McAnnally, president and chief executive officer. \"We remain focused on meeting evolving customer needs and advancing investments that position us for ongoing, sustainable growth.\" 2026 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE ONE Gas (the \"Company\") expects 2026 net income to be in the range of $294 million to $302 million, with earnings per diluted share of $4.65 to $4.77. The midpoints of 2026 guidance are net income of $298 million and earnings per diluted share of $4.71. The Company's 2026 earnings guidance includes the benefit of new rates and customer growth, partially offset by higher operating expenses and depreciation expense from capital investments. Capital investments, including asset removal costs, are expected to be approximately $800 million in 2026, primarily targeted for system integrity and replacement projects. Capital investments for extensions to new customers are expected to be approximately $230 million, largely due to continued growth opportunities in Texas and Oklahoma. The anticipated average rate base for 2026 is $6.3 billion. FIVE-YEAR FINANCIAL GROWTH RATES For the five years ending 2030, capital investments, including asset removal costs, are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million per year, or approximately $4.3 billion for the five-year period, including growth capital of approximately $1.2 billion. Capital expenditures support estimated average rate base growth of 7% to 9% per year through 2030. Exhibit 99.1 Annual net income and diluted earnings per share are expected to increase by an average of 7% to 9% and 5% to 7%, respectively, over the long term. Operating costs over the five-year period are expected to increase an average of approximately 3% to 4% per year, compared to the 4% average annual increase indicated in the 2025 financial guidance. The Company estimates total net long-term financing needs for the period 2026 through 2030 of approximately $1.3 billion, of which approximately 30% is expected to be equity. The Company has outstanding forward sale agreements covering approximately 2.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of approximately $78 per share. Had all forward shares been settled at the end of the third quarter, net proceeds would have been approximately $226 million. The Company expects to settle approximately $205 million of its outstanding equity under forward sale agreements at year-end 2025 and roll forward the remaining balance for settlement at year-end 2026. Consistent with last year's guidance, the Company expects to achieve an average annual dividend growth rate of 1% to 2% through 2030, subject to the board of directors' approval.

Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is used as a measure of the company's financial performance. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is defined as net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and certain other noncash items. This non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an indicator of financial performance of the company to generate cash flows sufficient to support our capital expenditure programs and pay dividends to our investors. ONE Gas cash flow from operations before changes in working capital should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of cash flow from operations before changes in working capital to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in this presentation.

Announces Investor/Analyst Day and Provides 4Q25 Update Boca Raton, FL, December 1, 2025 - NewtekOne, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"NewtekOne\") (NASDAQ: NEWT) is pleased to announce the following updates for its fourth quarter ending December 31, 2025 (\"4Q25\"). NewtekOne anticipates launching this month a securitization and sale of rated notes backed by alternative loan program (\"ALP\") loans. The securitization is anticipated to be the Company's largest ever, its fourth securitization of ALP loans, and its 17th overall. This securitization will be the Company's second ALP securitization in calendar year 2025. Quarter to date, NewtekOne has repurchased 100,670 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $10.20. Barry Sloane, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"With the uncertainty of the government shutdown behind us, we are comfortable that 2025 EPS should fall within our $2.10- $2.50 EPS guidance range and, since the government reopened, are pleased to have resumed sales of government guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans. As we approach 2026 and the three-year anniversary of transitioning to a financial holding company, we reflect positively on what we have accomplished operationally, including digitally opening almost 30,000 deposit accounts, and are excited about our prospects for continuing to operate and manage a true technology-oriented bank. The business and financial services and solutions we offer to our independent business owner clients enable them, through the Newtek Advantage, to grow revenue, to reduce expenses and risk, and to provide analytics, data, and transactional capabilities, which, we believe, are otherwise not available from a single source to this vital industry demographic.\" Mr. Sloane continued, \"We plan to host investors and analysts at our Boca Raton office headquarters on Thursday, January 8th to present operational and financial goals and projections for 2026. With returns on assets and on tangible common equity that should approximate 3% and 20% for 2025, respectively, and without the use of traditional commercial bankers and branches, we believe that NewtekOne is unlike most, if not all, publicly traded bank holding companies with a $300 million market cap. We have built a technology oriented digital bank by using software, people, and process to offer a frictionless environment for the business client to access a full menu of business and financial solutions 2 under the Newtek and NewtekOne brands which are designed to make our business client more successful.\" About NewtekOne, Inc. NewtekOne, Your Business Solutions Company, is a financial holding company, which along with its bank and non-bank consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, \"NewtekOne\"), provides a wide range of business and financial solutions under the Newtek brand to independent business owners.

(NASDAQ: LWAY) (\"Lifeway\" or the \"Company\"), a leading U.S. supplier of kefir and fermented probiotic products, today issued the following statement in response to Edward Smolyansky's (the \"Dissident\") intent to nominate George Sent, Managing Director of Cascadia Capital, and the Dissident (the \"Dissident Nominees\") for election to the Company's Board of Directors: Dear Fellow Shareholders, The track record of the Dissident Nominees demonstrates they are unfit to serve on the Company's Board of Directors and lead the Company and pose a clear risk to shareholder value. The Dissident Nominees have disqualifying issues raising ethical concerns. Ed Smolyansky: Terminated for cause as Lifeway's COO in 2022 Intoxicated on multiple occasions during the performance of his duties while an employee and director of Lifeway Subject to an emergency protection order prohibiting him from communicating with or going near Lifeway's CEO, Julie Smolyansky Founded a direct competitor of Lifeway Defaulted on a $10.4 million mortgage Created multiple false social media accounts to post negative false statements about Lifeway, including while he was serving as a Director of Lifeway Ludmila Smolyansky, the Dissident's mother, with whom the Dissident files Schedule 13Ds and votes: Facing over $2.3 million in federal and state tax liens George Sent, Managing director of Cascadia Capital As Lifeway's former Lead Independent Director and Chair of the special committee that investigated the Dissident's misconduct and recommended removing several of his titles and responsibilities, the Mr. Sent's sudden willingness to align himself with the Dissident is a disturbing reversal of principle that underscores questionable judgment and deeply concerning ethics. The Dissident's personal financial distress and that of Ludmila Smolyansky, his mother, and the limited amount of shares they can sell in the aggregate each calendar year seem to be fueling their demands for a sale of the Company at any price and could cause the Dissident Nominees to vote in ways that help the Dissident and his mother personally but are not in the best interests of other shareholders. The Dissident and his mother have repeatedly advocated for a sale of the Company, including after the stock closed at $5.07 per share on February 18, 2022, which is well below both the Company's current share price. The Dissident's default on a $10.4 million mortgage in 2025 and federal and state tax liens against Ludmila Smolyansky, Dissident's mother, among other debts, may have led Dissident and his mother to push for a quick sale of Lifeway at any price. In fact, first of Ludmila Smolyansky's $2.3 million in federal and state tax liens was filed about a year before she and the Dissident initially demanded that Lifeway run a sale process in 2022. In the last five years, neither the Dissident nor Ludmila Smolyansky has purchased a single share of Lifeway common stock. Instead, they have sold a total of more than 2.5 million shares of Lifeway common stock, including sales of more than 1.1 million shares at prices below $8.00 per share. The Dissident has not secured employment since his removal from Lifeway and claims to have made a substantial investment in a new venture he has alternated between calling \"a joke\" and describing as a kefir company intended to compete directly with Lifeway. In addition, he has created multiple false social media accounts which he used to post negative false statements about Lifeway, including while he was a member of Lifeway's Board of Directors. This pattern of contradictory statements, misinformation, and demonstrated financial irresponsibility raises grave concerns about his fitness to serve as a fiduciary, his ability to act in the best interests of all shareholders rather than himself and his mother, and his judgment in overseeing any public company. Even more troubling is that George Sent of Cascadia Capital has chosen to align himself with the Dissident despite this highly concerning information being readily available in the public record. ____________________ Source: Marion County Tax Warrant 30633661 for $93.48, filed December 29, 2022; Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service, Notice of Federal Tax Lien, Serial Number 464502222 for $649,758, dated December 19, 2022; Illinois Department of Revenue, Notice of Tax Lien, Lien ID 76443 for $188,054.20, dated October 21, 2022; Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service, Notice of Federal Tax Lien, Serial Number 447760322 for $730,269.35, dated January 12, 2022; Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service, Notice of Federal Tax Lien, Serial Number 438465121 for $756,414.23. Source: SEC filings. Institutional Shareholder Services ISS, has warned shareholders about the Dissident's prior director nominees including George Sent and proposals. In its July 2025 report, Institutional Shareholder Services (\"ISS\"), a leading proxy advisor, recommended Lifeway shareholders \"DO NOT VOTE\" on all proposals put forth by the Dissident and Ludumila Smolyansky and their aligned group, including Mr. Sent. The Dissident continues to make the same arguments for change as he has in the past. It's of concern to all shareholders that the dissident nominee George Sent a managing director of Cascadia capital, would stand for election with the dissident against ISS recommendations that are developed for the benefit of all shareholders ISS noted in connection with the Dissident's failed consent solicitation in 2025: that the dissident group \"has not presented a compelling case for change\" \"has not presented a plan should it successfully secure a majority of board seats\" for governance and operational improvement. Lifeway's \"financial performance has been directionally positive\" and its \"share price [has] rallied over the preceding year on multiple positive earnings announcements,\" with total shareholder return significantly outperforming peers in the Russell 3000 Food Producers Index. The dissident group's critiques \"are generally presented without adequate context,\" and the dissident group \"does not clearly establish how various developments have actually impacted shareholder returns.\" The dissident group \"has not presented a plan should it successfully secure a majority of board seats\" for governance or operational improvement. The dissident nominees include individuals who previously contributed to governance concerns during their past tenures at the Company. Lifeway's Board and management have delivered results. 788% total shareholder return over the past five years, dramatically outperforming peers and the S&P 500 [iii] ~123% revenue growth since FY2019 The Company's record-breaking 3 quarter 2025 marks six years of uninterrupted quarterly net sales growth The Company achieved $57.1 million in net sales in the 3 quarter of 2025, a 29% volume-led net sales increase on a comparable basis, driven by the Company's flagship Lifeway Kefir The Company's quarter 2025 gross margin expansion of 300 basis points and net income growth of 19% reflects the Company's disciplined operational execution ____________________ [iii] Source: Bloomberg data; covers the five-year period ended September 23, 2024, the last full trading day before Danone North America PBC publicly disclosed its initial unsolicited proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $25.00 per share Lifeway's Board is committed to refreshing the Board in a thoughtful manner replacing long serving directors and adding new directors whose skills and knowledge increase the Board's independence, breadth of experience and effectiveness In 2021 the Board added Dorri McWhorter, providing additional accounting and finance expertise, as well as experience growing a business as the CEO and adding an additional independent director. In 2022 Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Dalto, each with expertise in dairy consumer products at Danone and other global entities, joined the Board and Mr. Smolyansky was not renominated for election to the Board, replacing one non-independent director with an independent one and increasing the Board again with an additional independent director. In 2023 Ludmila Smolyansky, mother of Julie Smolyansky and Edward Smolyansky, was not renominated for election to the Board and ceased to serve as a director. As a result, the Board again became more independent, with only one non-independent member (the CEO). In 2024, the Company's Board refreshment proceedings were delayed to give time for the Board to review, negotiate and address various shareholder-related activities. On September 30, 2025, the Company and the Danone North America PBC (\"Danone\") entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the \"Cooperation Agreement\"). Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement: In October and November 2025, the Board appointed Rachel Drori, Andee Harris, Susie Hultquist and Kirk Chartier (the \"New Independent Board Members\"), each of whom is (1) independent under Nasdaq rules; (2) unaffiliated with Julie Smolyansky, her spouse, the Dissident, Ludmila Smolyansky, the Company and any current director of the Company; and (3) received prior written approval from Danone; The New Independent Board Members bring expertise in growing and selling businesses, accounting, finance, public company corporate governance, and expertise in the \"good for you\" food consumer product business, including in \"good for you\" drink products; and Pol Sikar, the longest serving director on the Board, has not been nominated for re-election at the 2025 Annual Meeting. Jason Scher, the next longest serving director on the Board will not be nominated for re-election at the 2026 Annual Meeting; and At or prior to the 2026 Annual Meeting, the Board will be made up of a majority of New Independent Board Members. Under the current Board as adjusted in 2026, Lifeway is well positioned for continued success, whether as an independent company or in a transaction that achieves a compelling value for Lifeway shareholders. Replacing any of the Company's current directors with the dissident candidates is not in the best interests of Lifeway or its shareholders. We urge you to reject the Dissidents' solicitation on behalf of the Dissident Nominees and the Dissident's proposal and protect the value of your investment. Sincerely, The Board of Directors of Lifeway About Lifeway Foods, Inc.

The Tender Offers are being made upon the terms and subject to conditions described in the Offer to Purchase, dated December 1, 2025 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the \"Offer to Purchase\"), which sets forth a detailed description of the Tender Offers. Notes validly tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Date will be accepted for purchase in priority to other Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date, subject to the Series Notes Caps and the Maximum Tender Payment, even if such Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than the Notes validly tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Date. The Company reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to increase or decrease any or both of the Series Notes Caps and/or the Maximum Tender Payment in its sole discretion at any time without extending or reinstating withdrawal rights, subject to compliance with applicable law. The Tender Offers for the Notes will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 30, 2025, or any other date and time to which the Company extends the applicable Tender Offer (such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the \"Expiration Date\"), unless earlier terminated. Holders of Notes must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes prior to or at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 12, 2025 (such date and time, as it may be extended with respect to a Tender Offer, the \"Early Tender Date\"), and the holder's Notes must be accepted for purchase, to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration (as defined below). If a holder validly tenders Notes after the applicable Early Tender Date but prior to or at the applicable Expiration Date, and the holder's Notes are accepted for purchase, the holder will only be eligible to receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration (as defined below).

Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date but prior to the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase will receive the Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Premium (with respect to each series of Notes, the \"Tender Offer Consideration\"). In addition to the consideration described above, all holders of Notes accepted for purchase in the Tender Offers will receive accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from the last interest payment date with respect to such Notes to, but not including, the applicable settlement date (\"Accrued Interest\"). The Company intends to fund the purchase of validly tendered and accepted Notes with available cash on hand and other sources of liquidity. The purpose of the Tender Offers is to purchase a portion of the Notes, subject to the Maximum Tender Payment and the Series Notes Caps, in order to reduce the Company's total outstanding public debt.

Except as set forth below, payment for the Notes that are validly tendered prior to or at the Expiration Date and that are accepted for purchase will be made on a date promptly following the Expiration Date, which is currently anticipated to be December 31, 2025, the first business day after the Expiration Date.

The Company is not obligated to conduct any early settlement or have any early settlement occur on any particular date. Tendered Notes may be withdrawn prior to or at, but not after, 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 12, 2025.

On November 24, 2025 (the \"Effective Date\"), ScanTech AI Systems Inc. (the \"Company\") entered into the Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Supplemental Agreement (the \"Agreement\") by and between the Company, Karl Brenza (for limited purposes), ScanTech Identification Beam Systems LLC (\"SIBS\"), Steele Interest SIBS LLC (\"Steele I\"), Steele Interest SIBS II LLC (\"Steele II\"), Steele Interest SIBS III LLC (\"Steele III\"), Steele Interest SIBS IV LLC (\"Steele IV\" and together with Steele I, Steele II, and Steele III, referred to as the \"Steele Lenders\"), and Steele Interest LLC (\"Steele Interests\" and, collectively with the Steele Lenders, \"Steele\"). The Agreement amends the Supplemental Agreement (the \"Supplemental Agreement\") entered into with the same parties on January 31, 2025 which related to the Loan Exchange & Release Agreement entered into on September 25, 2025. Pursuant to the Agreement, on the Satisfaction Date (as defined below), the mutual release and waiver provided for in accordance with the Supplemental Agreement shall no longer be subject to Section G of the Supplemental Agreement which shall be deleted in its entirety. Section G of the Supplemental Agreement had originally conditioned the mutual release and waiver provided for by the Supplemental Agreement on the condition that Taylor Freres Americas LLP, TFGS VII Gestion LLC, Zachary Taylor, and their affiliates (the \"TF Parties\") extend the date by which the business combination agreement, entered into by the Company, SIBS, and Mars Acquisition Corp., must close by January 2, 2025 and that the TF Parties and the Company release all claims against each other. In addition, pursuant to the Agreement, up and until the Satisfaction Date, the Steele Lenders agree not to object to any settlement agreement entered into by and between the Company and the TF Parties so long as the settlement agreement does not involve any compensation paid to the TF Parties other than in the form of common stock of the Company and the amendment to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-284806) (the \"Resale Registration Statement\") has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") by January 30, 2026. The \"Satisfaction Date\" is defined as the date on which each of the following shall have occurred: (i) the First Additional Shares (as defined in the Supplemental Agreement), the Second Additional Shares (as defined in the Supplemental Agreement), the Steele Shares (as defined below) and the Legal and Expense Shares (as defined below) have all been included to be registered in the Resale Registration Statement; (ii) the Resale Registration Statement shall have been filed with the SEC prior to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern) on January 30, 2026; (ii) the Company has issued and delivered, or caused to be issued and delivered, the First Additional Shares, the Second Additional Shares, the Steele Shares, the Legal and Expense Shares and the Exchange Agreement Shares (as defined below) to an account for the benefit of Steele at Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (\"Continental\"); and (d) the Resale Registration Statement has been declared effective by the SEC. The Company and SIBS each acknowledged and agreed that they, on a joint and several basis, are justly indebted to, and currently owe and shall pay, the Steele Lenders a total of $550,000 as reimbursement of legal fees paid and/or previously incurred by the Steele Lenders in connection with certain loans made by the Steele Lenders to SIBS and the Exchange Agreement (as defined in the Supplemental Agreement) (collectively, the \"Steele Legal Fees\"). No later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern) on November 25, 2025, the Company agreed to issue and deliver to Steele, at Continental, 2,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock (the \"Legal and Expense Shares\"), to cover in full the obligation of the Company and SIBS to pay to Steele for (or reimburse Steele for the payment of) the Steele Legal Fees. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company is also obligated to issue 1,200,000 shares consisting of the First Tranche Shares (as defined below). Under the Agreement, as soon as possible (but not later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern) on January 30, 2026), the Company agreed to submit to the SEC an amendment to the Resale Registration Statement, which amendment shall include for registration (a) the First Additional Shares, (b) the Second Additional Shares, (c) the Steele Shares and (d) the Legal and Expense Shares. The Company is obligated to use its best and continuous efforts to cause the Resale Registration Statement, as so amended, to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as reasonably possible following the filing or submission thereof (taking into account that the SEC may review and comment on the amended Resale Registration Statement). No later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern) on November 25, 2025, the Company agreed to issue and deliver to an account for the benefit of Steele Interests, at Continental, 1,200,000 shares of the Company's common stock (the \"First Tranche Shares\"). In the event that the amendment to the Resale Registration Statement has not been submitted to the SEC by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern) on December 1, 2025, then the Company is obligated to immediately issue and deliver to an account for the benefit of Steele Interests, at Continental, an additional 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock (the \"First Increase Shares\"). Thereafter, in the event that the amendment to the Resale Registration Statement has not been submitted to the SEC by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern) on December 15, 2025, then the Company is obligated to immediately issue and deliver to an account for the benefit of Steele Interests, at Continental, an additional 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock (the \"Second Increase Shares\").

Thereafter, in the event that the amendment to the Resale Registration Statement has not been submitted to the SEC by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern) on January 15, 2026, then the Company is obligated to immediately issue and deliver to an account for the benefit of Steele Interests, at Continental, an additional 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock (the \"Fourth Increase Shares\"). Thereafter, in the event that the amendment to the Resale Registration Statement has not been submitted to the SEC by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern) on January 30, 2026, then the Company is obligated to immediately issue and deliver to an account for the benefit of Steele Interests, at Continental, an additional 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock (the \"Fifth Increase Shares\"). \"Steele Shares\" means the First Tranche Shares plus, as applicable, the First Increase Shares, the Second Increase Shares, the Third Increase Shares, the Fourth Increase Shares and the Fifth Increase Shares. Pursuant to the Supplemental Agreement, the Company previously issued a total of 1,000,000 shares to various of the Steele Lenders, consisting of 800,000 shares (the \"Exchange Agreement Shares\"), the 100,000 First Additional Shares, and the 100,000 Second Additional Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement or the Supplemental Agreement, in no event will the Company be required to (a) issue shares of the Company's common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for the Company's common stock (including the First Additional Shares, the Second Additional Shares, the Steele Shares, the Legal and Expense Shares, and the Exchange Agreement Shares) exceeding 19.99% of the Company's common stock or exceeding 19.99% of the voting power outstanding either as of the Effective Date or the date immediately preceding the Effective Date, as determined in accordance with the relevant stock exchange rules, or (b) otherwise issue shares of the Company's common stock or other securities which issuance would violate any rule of the SEC or the relevant stock exchange or trading market on which the Company's common stock is then listed or quoted.

EBITDA is a non - GAAP financial measure defined as net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation expen se, amortization expense, interest expense, share - based compensation and income tax. Gross profit is defined as total revenue less commissions paid to financial advisors and registered representatives and other fees that gener ate the revenue. We consider our gross profit amounts to be non - GAAP financial measures that may not be comparable to those of others in our industry. We believe that gross profit amounts can provide investors with useful insight in to our core operating performance before other costs that are general and administrative in nature.

Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating income (loss) margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included below. This non-GAAP information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures that Credo presents may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of share-based compensation expenses, asset impairment and related charges (if applicable), and the related tax effect adjustment to the provision for income taxes. Credo uses a full-year non-GAAP tax rate to compute the non-GAAP tax provision. This full-year non-GAAP tax rate is based on Credo's annual GAAP income, adjusted to exclude non-GAAP items, as well as the effects of significant non-recurring and period-specific tax items which vary in size and frequency. Credo's non-GAAP tax rate is determined on an annual basis and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events that may materially affect the non-GAAP tax rate, such as tax law changes, significant changes in Credo's geographic mix of revenue and expenses or changes to Credo's corporate structure. GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share is calculated using basic weighted average shares outstanding when there is a GAAP net loss, and calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding when there is a GAAP net income. Non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share is calculated using basic weighted average shares outstanding when there is a non-GAAP net loss, and calculated using non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding when there is a non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP adjustment for the number of shares used in the diluted per share calculations excludes the impact of share-based compensation expenses expected to be incurred in future periods and not yet recognized in the financial statements, which would otherwise be assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method. Credo believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Credo's financial condition and results of operations. While Credo uses non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance its understanding of certain aspects of its financial performance, Credo does not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Consistent with this approach, Credo believes that disclosing non-GAAP financial measures to the readers of its financial statements provides such readers with useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP financial measures, allows for greater transparency in the review of its financial and operational performance. Externally, management believes that investors may find Credo's non-GAAP financial measures useful in their assessment of Credo's operating performance and the valuation of Credo. Internally, Credo's non-GAAP financial measures are used in the following areas: Management's evaluation of Credo's ongoing operating performance; Management's establishment of internal operating budgets; and Management's performance comparisons with internal forecasts and targeted business models. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of Credo's business as determined in accordance with GAAP. As a result, you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Credo's results as reported under GAAP. The exclusion of the above items from our GAAP financial metrics does not necessarily mean that these costs are unusual or infrequent.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9973410964012146}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9980828762054443}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9983224272727966}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9983564019203186}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995290040969849}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995214939117432}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995461106300354}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995536208152771}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992733597755432}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994016885757446}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995483756065369}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995788931846619}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999580442905426}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995856881141663}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995658993721008}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995506405830383}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996187686920166}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995505213737488}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995579123497009}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995543360710144}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996125102043152}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996122717857361}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996126294136047}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9963801503181458}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995396137237549}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999606192111969}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995880722999573}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995883107185364}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995391368865967}], "sentiment": "neutral"}], "overall_sentiment": "neutral", "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": null}, "000119312525303879": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1959568/000119312525303879/d84590d8k.htm", "filing_date": "Mon, 1 Dec 2025 16:07:43 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": false, "ticker": null, "items": {}, "exhibits": [], "overall_sentiment": null, "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": "Missing ticker or items"}, "000146212025000110": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1462120/000146212025000110/lob-20251201.htm", "filing_date": "Mon, 1 Dec 2025 16:07:33 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": true, "ticker": "LOB", "items": {"item 5.02": {"text": "Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers Effective December 1, 2025, Live Oak Bancshares, Inc.

Reflecting this strength, we are raising our guidance on the top and bottom line for the rest of the year,\" said CJ Desai, President and Chief Executive Officer of MongoDB. \"Q3 was an exceptional quarter. Existing customers are expanding with us and net-new customer additions continue to show strength. Companies across industries and geographies are choosing MongoDB because we provide a unified data platform that powers mission-critical workloads today and also positions them to capitalize on the emerging AI platform shift.\" Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Highlights Revenue: Total revenue was $628.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, an increase of 19% year-over-year.

MongoDB used $1.7 million of cash in capital expenditures and used $1.7 million of cash in principal payments of finance leases, leading to free cash flow of $140.1 million, compared to free cash flow of $34.6 million in the year-ago period. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has been provided in the financial statement tables included at the end of this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 and Recent Business Highlights MongoDB appointed Chirantan \"CJ\" Desai as President and Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Dev Ittycheria, who held the role for 11 years. CJ comes to MongoDB with an exceptional blend of product and engineering leadership, strong go-to-market execution, and firsthand experience scaling some of the world's most transformative software companies. MongoDB has been recognized as a Leader for the fourth consecutive year in the 2025 Gartner Magic QuadrantTM for Cloud Database Management Systems (CDBMS). This recognition reflects the company's execution strength, innovation velocity, and continued leadership in redefining what a modern database platform can do in the era of AI. Our placement underscores MongoDB's position as the trusted foundation for enterprises seeking agility, scalability, and AI readiness across every application. MongoDB announced the availability of its search and vector search capabilities within MongoDB Community Edition and MongoDB Enterprise Server. Previously exclusive to the fully managed MongoDB Atlas cloud platform, developers and organizations of all sizes can now access the preview of robust full-text search and vector search capabilities on MongoDB's local, on-premises, and self-managed offeringsall with the world's most popular modern database. MongoDB was named the 2025 Microsoft United States Partner of the Year at the Microsoft Ignite conference in San Francisco. MongoDB also launched a number of AI development, security, and governance technology integrations with Microsoft that solidify MongoDB's position as the best data foundation for AI on Microsoft Azure. Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2026 Guidance Based on information available to management as of today, December 1, 2025, MongoDB is issuing the following financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2026. Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2026 Full Year Fiscal 2026 Revenue $665.0 million to $670.0 million $2.434 billion to $2.439 billion Non-GAAP Income from Operations $139.0 million to $143.0 million $436.4 million to $440.4 million Non-GAAP Net Income per Share $1.44 to $1.48 $4.76 to $4.80 Reconciliations of non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per share guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of stock-based compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in MongoDB's stock price. MongoDB expects the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on its future GAAP financial results. Conference Call Information MongoDB will host a conference call today, December 1, 2025, at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss its financial results and business outlook. A live webcast of the call will be available on the \"Investor Relations\" page of MongoDB's website at https://investors.mongodb.com.

(Nasdaq: SLP) (\"Simulations Plus\" or the \"Company\"), a global leader in cheminformatics, biosimulation, clinical operations solutions and medical communications that accelerate biopharma innovation, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2025, ended August 31, 2025.

Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, we anticipate low single-digit revenue growth at the mid-point of the guidance range, assuming current market conditions remain. Importantly, we believe we are well-positioned to capture upside should the spending environment improve for our pharmaceutical and biotech clients.\" \"The demand environment remains cautious, but we believe adoption of cloud deployment, interoperability, and AI-driven workflows is accelerating across our customer base. Following our successful transition to a functionally optimized structure, our product and technology team is launching an ambitious product vision that links our validated modeling engines with cloud-scale compute, AI-assisted workflows, and a stronger compliance and identity framework. Cloud-scale performance for intensive modeling, AI copilots that simplify complex workflows, and federated data capabilities aligned with enterprise and regulatory expectations will cut cycle times, increase cross-product adoption, and open new enterprise opportunities all while preserving the accuracy and scientific depth our customers depend on. With validated science at the core of every product, we believe Simulations Plus is well positioned to lead the next chapter of AI-enabled drug development. We look forward to sharing more of our integrated product vision at Investor Day in January, concluded O'Connor.\" Fiscal 2026 Guidance Simulations Plus is reaffirming its previously provided fiscal year 2026 guidance as follows: Fiscal 2026 Guidance Total Revenue $79M - $82M Total Revenue Growth 0 - 4% Software Revenue Mix 57 - 62% Adjusted EBITDA Margin 26 - 30% Adjusted Diluted EPS $1.03 - $1.10 Webcast and Conference Call Details Shawn O'Connor, Chief Executive Officer, and Will Frederick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will host a conference call and webcast today, December 1 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the results and certain forward-looking information.

More details will be provided closer to the event. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains \"non-GAAP financial measures,\" which are measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). A further explanation and reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is included below and in the financial tables in this release. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of its results between periods. The Company's management uses non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS represent measures that we believe are customarily used by investors and analysts to evaluate the financial performance of companies in addition to the GAAP measures that we present. Our management also believes that these measures are useful in evaluating our core operating results. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, or diluted EPS as indicators of our operating performance or to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. We believe the Company's Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Diluted EPS measures provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other peer companies in our industry, but other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to nonrecurring, unusual items. Please note that the Company has not reconciled the adjusted EBITDA or adjusted diluted earnings per share forward-looking guidance included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to costs related to acquisitions, financings, and employee stock compensation programs, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding the effect of interest expense (income), provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation expense, loss (gain) on currency exchange, impairment charges, change in fair value of contingent consideration, reorganization expense, acquisition and integration expense and other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the effect of amortization, equity-based compensation expense, loss (gain) on currency exchange, impairment charges, change in fair value of contingent consideration, reorganization expense, acquisition and integration expense and other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance as well as the income tax provision adjustment for such charges. The Company excludes the above items because they are outside of the Company's normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately. About Simulations Plus, Inc.

(the \"Company\") entered into a warrant inducement agreement (the \"Inducement Agreement\") with a certain holder named therein (the \"Holder\") of Series C-1 Common Stock Purchase Warrants to purchase up to 4,025,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \"Common Stock\"), originally issued on May 5, 2025 (the \"Series C-1 Warrants\") and Series E Common Stock Purchase Warrants to purchase up to 5,190,675 shares of Common Stock issued on June 18, 2025 (the \"Series E Warrants\" and together with the Series C-1 Warrants, the \"Existing Warrants\"). Pursuant to the Inducement Agreement, the Holder of the Existing Warrants agreed to exercise for cash the Existing Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,215,675 shares of Common Stock, at a reduced exercise price of $0.31 per share. The transactions contemplated by the Inducement Agreement closed on November 28, 2025. The Company received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $2.86 million, before deducting financial advisory fees and other expenses payable by the Company. In consideration of the Holder's immediate exercise of the Existing Warrants in accordance with the Inducement Agreement, the Company issued unregistered Series F Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the \"New Warrants\") to purchase up to 13,823,512 shares of Common Stock (the \"New Warrant Shares\"). In addition, pursuant to the Inducement Agreement, and subject to certain exceptions, the Company agreed not to, until 60 days from the date of the Inducement Agreement, (i) enter into or effect any issuance of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (as defined in the Inducement Agreement), or (ii) file any registration statement or any amendment or supplement to any existing registration statement, which certain exceptions include, sales of Common Srock pursuant to an \"at the market offering\" with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (\"AGP\") (the \"ATM Offering\") beginning on the 31st day following the date of the Inducement Agreement and the filing of the Resale Registration Statement (as defined below). The Company has also agreed not to enter into a Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the Inducement Agreement) for a period of six (6) months following the date of the Inducement Agreement, provided however that sales pursuant to the ATM Offering are permitted to be made beginning on the 31st day following the date of the Inducement Agreement. The issuance of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Existing Warrants have been registered pursuant to, (i) with respect to the Series C-1 Warrants, an existing registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-287679), which was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on June 9, 2025, and (ii) with respect to the Series E Warrants, an existing registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-287826), which was declared effective by the SEC on June 16, 2025. The Company agreed in the Inducement Agreement to file a registration statement to register the resale of the New Warrant Shares (the \"Resale Registration Statement\") within thirty (30) days following the date of the Inducement Agreement, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to have such Resale Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC within sixty (60) days (or, in the event of a full review, ninety (90) calendar days) following the date of the Inducement Agreement. The Company further agreed in the Inducement Agreement to seek approval from its stockholders of the full exercise of the New Warrants and the issuance of all of the New Warrant Shares upon the exercise thereof (\"Stockholder Approval\"), it being understood that no portion of the New Warrants may be exercised until such Stockholder Approval is obtained. The Company shall hold an annual or special meeting of its stockholders on or prior to the date that is one hundred and twenty (120) days following the Closing Date (as defined in the Inducement Agreement) for the purpose of obtaining Stockholder Approval. If the Company does not obtain all components of the Stockholder Approval at the first such meeting, the Company shall call a meeting every ninety (90) days thereafter to seek Stockholder Approval until the earlier of the date on which Stockholder Approval is obtained or the New Warrants are no longer outstanding. 1 The Company expects to use the net proceeds from these transactions for working capital and other general corporate purposes. AGP served as the Company's financial advisor in connection with the transactions described in the Inducement Agreement, and the Company agreed to pay AGP a financial advisory fee of 8.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised in connection with the issuance and sale of securities covered by the Inducement Agreement and $25,000 for legal fees. AGP Terms of the New Warrants The New Warrants have an exercise price of $0.31 per share, subject to adjustment as provided in the New Warrants, will be exercisable at any time on or after the date on which the Company receives Stockholder Approval (the \"Stockholder Approval Date\") and have a term of exercise of twenty-four (24) months from the Stockholder Approval Date. If at the time of exercise there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for the resale of, the New Warrant Shares by the Holder, then the New Warrant may also be exercised, in whole or in part, at such time by means of a \"cashless exercise.\" The exercise price and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each New Warrant are subject to appropriate adjustments in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the Common Stock. In the event of a fundamental transaction, as described in the New Warrants, the holders of the New Warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the New Warrants the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that the holders would have received had they exercised the New Warrants immediately prior to such fundamental transaction. In addition, in certain circumstances, upon a fundamental transaction, the holder will have the right to require us to repurchase its New Warrants at the Black Scholes Value; provided, however, that, if the fundamental transaction is not within the Company's control, including not approved by the Company's board of directors, then the holder shall only be entitled to receive the same type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion), at the Black Scholes Value of the unexercised portion of the New Warrant, that is being offered and paid to the holders of Common Stock in connection with the fundamental transaction. The Company may not effect the exercise of New Warrants, and the applicable Holder will not be entitled to exercise any portion of any such New Warrants, which, upon giving effect to such exercise, would cause the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the holder of such New Warrants (together with its affiliates) to exceed 4.99% or 9.99%, as applicable, of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of such New Warrants. Except as otherwise provided in the New Warrants or by virtue of the Holder's ownership of shares of Common Stock, such holder of New Warrants does not have the rights or privileges of a holder of Common Stock, including any voting rights, until such holder exercises such holder's New Warrants. The New Warrants will provide that the holders of the New Warrants have the right to participate in distributions or dividends paid on shares of Common Stock. The foregoing descriptions of each of the Inducement Agreement and the New Warrants do not purport to be complete and are each qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the forms of the Inducement Agreement and New Warrants, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 4.1, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. The Company notes that the representations, warranties and covenants made by the Company in any agreement that is incorporated by reference herein were made solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, including, in some cases, for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties to such agreements.

Moreover, such representations, warranties or covenants were accurate only as of the date when made, except where expressly stated otherwise. Accordingly, such representations, warranties and covenants should not be relied on as accurately representing the current state of the Company's affairs at any time. 2 The New Warrants described herein have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and may not be sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.

About Adial Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Adial is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapies for the treatment and prevention of addiction and related disorders. The Company's lead investigational new drug product, AD04, is a genetically targeted, serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, therapeutic agent for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) in heavy drinking patients and was recently investigated in the Company's ONWARDTM pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for the potential treatment of AUD in subjects with certain target genotypes identified using the Company's proprietary companion diagnostic genetic test.

The company has transitioned majority ownership to a newly formed leadership group made up of current and former MRINetwork franchise owners. HireQuest will retain partial ownership and continue to support the brand with essential infrastructure, purchasing power, and shared services across its staffing and recruiting network. The new leadership group comprises: Todd Govig (Govig & Associates) Mark Angott (Angott Search Group) Mike Brown (Harrison Group) Mark and Jay Schwartz (The Richmond Group USA) Shana Applebaum (current Managing Partner and Chief Revenue Officer/ Northbound Executive Search, who has been appointed Managing Director of MRINetwork) In her new role, Shana Applebaum, based in New York City, will lead a strategic reset of the MRINetwork with a sharp focus on growth, strengthening client partnerships and uniting the global network of offices into a cohesive, high-performing organization. \"This is a tremendous moment for MRINetwork,\" said Rick Hermanns, CEO of HireQuest. \"By aligning the brand's leadership with experienced franchise owner-operators, we ensure the network is guided by those who live its mission each day. Shana's history of joining organizations and fueling growth makes her the perfect leader to take MRINetwork into its next chapter. HireQuest remains fully committed to MRINetwork's success by providing shared services, scale advantages and integrated staffing-and-recruiting solutions to our clients. Together, we will accelerate value for existing owners and the brand's future.\" \"I am honored to step into the role of Managing Director at MRINetwork,\" said Shana Applebaum. \"Alongside our new leadership team, we will leverage our deep recruiting expertise, strengthen best-practice processes, and build a network that is more connected and primed for growth. I'm excited to bring our offices closer together, enhance collaboration, and position MRINetwork for long-term success. This is about elevating our offerings, building trust, and demonstrating the true power of a unified recruiting network.\" Why this transaction matters: Franchise-owner leadership: The new ownership group brings hands-on recruiting and franchise experience. Their deep domain expertise will inform network strategy, operational best practices and client-service excellence. HireQuest shared services continuity: By remaining a partial owner, HireQuest will continue to deliver the value of the broader organization: national purchasing scale; integrated staffing and recruiting solutions; technology, training and back-office infrastructure; and a one-stop-shop approach for clients with complex talent needs. Enhanced value for current and future owners: For current MRINetwork offices, this alignment positions the brand to benefit from both entrepreneurial leadership and the backing of a larger staffing organization. It strengthens the network's market position, growth potential and attractiveness to future franchisees. Industry context: Despite headwinds in parts of the executive search market, signs of renewed activity are emerging with major executive recruiting-segment firms seeing a positive revenue impact driven by demographic trends and near-record executive turnover. This underlines the opportunity for a well-positioned network like MRINetwork to capture meaningful growth. Transaction and Next Steps: The transaction is expected to close in the coming weeks, subject to customary closing conditions. Once completed, the new leadership group will collaborate with HireQuest to unveil an enhanced service model and network-wide rollout of strategic initiatives beginning in Q1 2026.

She began her career in retail management but transitioned into retail field recruiting right before the Great Recession, quickly proving her ability to turn challenges into opportunities. Over her nine years at JBC, a global consumer search practice, Applebaum played a key role in launching national accounts across the lifestyle, fashion, and consumer goods sectors, while also driving the firm's expansion into international markets. During her tenure, JBC partnered with leading Fortune 500 companies including Unilever, Nestl, and LVMH (Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany & Co., among others), strengthening its position as a trusted partner for global talent needs. Later, at Northbound Executive Search, she joined the Corporate Services group, where she oversaw Corporate Services along with the Consulting division, and launched the Accounting Services division. It was there that Applebaum deepened her understanding of the recruiting business, honing her assertive approach and building a reputation for operational discipline, client acquisition, and revenue growth.

The Company is including the below updates to its risk factors for the purpose of supplementing and updating the corresponding risk factors contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 27, 2025, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on November 6, 2025. It is unlikely that our ongoing review of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction being consummated outside of a bankruptcy process. On March 12, 2025, we announced that our board of directors is conducting a review of strategic alternatives, including, but not limited to, exploring a potential sale or strategic transaction and refinancing our debt. In late October, the counterparty to a potential sale transaction withdrew from the process following a lengthy period of exclusive negotiations. We are continuing the strategic review process. On November 24, 2025, Santrum Hong Kong Co., Limited (\"Santrum\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co., Ltd. (f/k/a Shenzhen 3irobotix Co., Ltd.) (\"Picea\"), our primary contract manufacturer, acquired from various affiliates of The Carlyle Group (the \"Original Lenders\") all of the rights and interests of the lenders under the Credit Agreement entered into on July 24, 2023, as amended, by and among us, TCG Senior Funding L.L.C., an affiliate of The Carlyle Group, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the Original Lenders (the \"Credit Agreement\"), which includes assumption of the $190.7 million in principal and interest outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of November 24, 2025. In addition, as of November 24, 2025, we owe Picea $161.5 million for the manufacturing of our products, $90.9 million of which was past due. We are currently in discussions with Picea regarding a mutually agreeable resolution of our non-payment of amounts owed to Picea and alternatives for obtaining the additional capital we require to fund our ongoing business operations. It is unlikely that our ongoing strategic review process or our discussions with Picea will result in any transaction (including any potential transaction with Picea) being consummated outside of a bankruptcy process. In bankruptcy proceedings, it is unlikely that any proceeds would remain for distribution to stockholders and, as a result, stockholders would likely receive no recovery and will lose all of their investment in us. Whether the process will result in any transactions, our ability to complete any such transaction, and if our board of directors decides to pursue one or more transactions, will depend on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control. Such factors include the interest of potential acquirers or strategic partners in a potential transaction, the value potential acquirers or strategic partners attribute to our business or assets, regulatory approvals, market conditions, and industry trends. Any potential strategic transaction that requires stockholder approval may not be approved by our stockholders or, if required, a counterparty's stockholders. Furthermore, any strategic transaction into which we enter may be delayed or may ultimately not be consummated as a result of regulatory reviews (which may include domestic and foreign antitrust, CFIUS or other regulatory agency reviews) and determinations or other factors. The price of our common stock decreased significantly following our public announcement of our 2024 financial results and the initiation of our review of strategic alternatives, as well as following our October 27, 2025 announcement regarding an update on our strategic review process and the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q on November 6, 2025. The price of our common stock may be further adversely affected for a variety of reasons relating to our current business and financial condition, including uncertainty regarding our business prospects and the status and ultimate outcome of the strategic review process. Even if one or more transactions are completed outside of a bankruptcy process, there can be no assurance that any such transactions will be successful or have a positive effect on stockholder value, including that the price per share to stockholders in a sale transaction may be less than the then-current trading price of our stock. During our negotiations for a potential sale transaction with the counterparty that withdrew from the process in late October, the counterparty offered a price per share to acquire our company that was significantly lower than the trading price of our stock over the recent months prior to the counterparty's withdrawal. The attention of management and our board of directors could continue to be diverted from our core business operations as a result of this strategic review process. We have diverted capital and other resources to the process that otherwise could have been used in our business operations, and we expect to continue to do so until the process is completed. We have incurred substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives, including those related to employee retention payments, equity compensation, severance pay and legal, accounting and financial advisor fees. A considerable portion of these expenses have been, and may continue to be, incurred regardless of whether a transaction is completed. In addition, the process could lead us to lose or fail to attract, retain and motivate key employees, and to lose or fail to attract customers or business partners. Furthermore, it could expose us to litigation. The public announcement of a strategic alternative may also yield a negative impact on operating results if prospective or existing customers, vendors or partners are reluctant to commit to new or renewed contracts. Our financial results and operations could be adversely affected by the strategic process and by the uncertainty regarding its outcome. We do not intend to disclose further developments or provide further updates on the progress or status of the strategic process until our board of directors deems further disclosure is appropriate or necessary. Accordingly, speculation regarding any developments related to the review of strategic alternatives and perceived uncertainties related to the future of our company could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks related to the uncertainty caused by our evaluation of strategic alternatives, it could disrupt our business and adversely impact operating results and financial condition. The waiver of covenant compliance under our senior secured term loan credit facility is time-limited; if this waiver is not extended at the end of the applicable period, we will be in default. Our financial condition continues to decline, and we may be unable to secure the additional funding needed to continue our operations. On November 24, 2025, Santrum, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Picea, acquired all of the rights and interests of the lenders under the Credit Agreement (including the $190.7 million in principal and interest outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of November 24, 2025). Picea is our primary manufacturing partner. As of November 24, 2025, we owed Picea $161.5 million for the manufacturing of our products, $90.9 million of which was past due. Immediately following the transaction described above, we entered into Amendment No. 7 and Limited Consent to Credit Agreement (\"Amendment No. 7\") with Santrum. Pursuant to Amendment No. 7, Santrum extended until January 15, 2026 the waiver of our covenant obligations to (1) provide a report and opinion of our auditor with respect to our annual financial statements for fiscal year 2024 without a qualification regarding our ability to continue as a going concern (the \"Going Concern Covenant\") and (2) maintain a minimum level of core assets (the \"Minimum Core Assets Covenant\" and together with the Going Concern Covenant, the \"Specified Covenants\"). We previously entered into six amendments to the Credit Agreement between March and October 2025 with the Original Lenders that waived, collectively, compliance with the Specified Covenants for periods from March 11, 2025 until December 1, 2025. No event of default will occur under the Credit Agreement as a result of failure to comply with the Specified Covenants through January 15, 2026; however, we are still obligated to comply with the Specified Covenants thereafter and if we do not, unless Santrum further extends the waiver by January 15, 2026, an event of default will occur. The auditor report on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024 includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; therefore, we would be in breach of the Going Concern Covenant and Santrum would be able to exercise all applicable remedies under the Credit Agreement but for the waiver of breach through January 15, 2026 as described above. The earliest we would be able to regain compliance with the Going Concern Covenant is upon the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending January 3, 2026, which is not due until March 2026. As a result, we are dependent on continued waivers from Santrum to avoid an event of default related to the Going Concern Covenant, which waivers are in Santrum's sole discretion. We cannot assure you that Santrum will provide any additional waiver of compliance with the Specified Covenants by January 15, 2026. Any failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in the Credit Agreement (including the Specified Covenants after January 15, 2026) would result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement, which may result in the termination of the Credit Agreement and acceleration of repayment obligations with respect to any outstanding loans. In addition, Santrum would have the right to proceed against the collateral in which we granted a security interest, which consists of substantially all our assets. As of September 27, 2025, the fair value of the Term Loan was $205.3 million and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $24.8 million. If we are in default under the Credit Agreement and Santrum accelerates the repayment obligations with respect to the outstanding loans, we would be unable to repay our obligations under the Credit Agreement. In such circumstances, or if in advance of January 15, 2026 Santrum informs us that it will not further extend the waiver, we may be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations and would likely seek bankruptcy protection. In such bankruptcy proceedings, it is unlikely that any proceeds would remain for distribution to stockholders and, as a result, stockholders would likely receive no recovery and will lose all of their investment in us. In addition, our unsecured creditors would likely receive little to no recovery in such bankruptcy proceedings. The Credit Agreement includes certain restrictions on the use of $40.0 million of the termination payment received by us from Amazon.com, Inc. in early 2024 (the \"Restricted Cash\"), which the remaining amount thereof (after giving effect to certain periods for such amounts to be used for inventory in limited circumstances and upon satisfying certain conditions) would ultimately have been required to prepay a portion of the loan under the Credit Agreement. In connection with Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement, we paid $4.0 million of the Restricted Cash to the Original Lenders, and as of November 24, 2025, we have drawn down the remaining $36.0 million of the Restricted Cash to fund our ongoing business operations. As such, we have no sources upon which we can draw additional capital at this time. We are currently in discussions with Picea regarding alternatives for obtaining the additional capital we require to fund our ongoing business operations and regarding a mutually agreeable resolution of our non-payment of amounts owed to Picea. There can be no assurance that we and Picea will find a mutually agreeable path toward funding our ongoing business operations or reach a mutually agreeable resolution regarding the outstanding payables. If we are unable to find sources of capital in the near term, or resolve our significant outstanding payables to Picea, we may be forced to significantly curtail or cease operations and would likely seek bankruptcy protection. The Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, grant or incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make certain restricted investments or payments, including payment of dividends on our capital stock and payments on certain permitted indebtedness, enter into certain mergers and acquisitions or engage in certain asset sales, subject in each case to certain exceptions. The terms of our outstanding debt may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to execute business strategies in the manner desired. In addition, complying with the covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy, invest in our growth strategy, and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions. We primarily rely on Picea as our single contract manufacturer, and our business and results of operations depend significantly on this manufacturer continuing production. In recent years, we have increasingly depended on third-party contract manufacturers to produce our products. These contract manufacturers manage the supply chain for all of the raw materials and provide all facilities and labor required to manufacture our products. Currently, we primarily depend on a single contract manufacturer, Picea, located in China and Vietnam, to manufacture our products pursuant to an agreement we extended in July 2025 through August 17, 2027. Either party has the option to terminate the agreement for convenience with 180 days' advance written notice. As of November 24, 2025, we owed Picea $161.5 million for the manufacturing of our products, $90.9 million of which was past due. Under our agreement with Picea, non-payment may be deemed a breach of a material provision of the agreement, which if not cured within 30 business days of receipt of written notice from Picea, will allow Picea to terminate the agreement. As of the date hereof, Picea has not issued a written notice of default under the agreement, and the parties are engaged in active discussions regarding a mutually agreeable resolution of our non-payment of amounts owed to Picea. If Picea terminates its agreement with us or otherwise fails to provide the required contract manufacturing services, production capacity, shipping, and product quality on a timely basis, there would be a significant disruption in manufacturing our products and our business operations and financial results would be materially adversely affected. It is unlikely that we would be able to establish alternative manufacturing arrangements with any replacement contract manufacturer on acceptable terms or in a timely manner. Any significant interruption in manufacturing at Picea would reduce the supply of our products, which could cause a delay in fulfillment of our orders or breach of our agreements with distribution partners, which in turn would reduce our revenue. Any adverse change in Picea's financial or business conditions, including as a result of our non-payment of amounts owed to Picea, could also disrupt our ability to supply our products. Our reliance on contract manufacturers, including Picea, involves certain product supply risks, including the following: lack of direct control over production capacity and delivery schedules; lack of direct control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs; lack of enforceable contractual provisions over the production and costs of consumer products; risk of loss of inventory while in transit; and risk of increased shipping and air freight costs, including as a result of attacks on commercial ships. Any interruption in the manufacture of our products would be likely to result in delays in shipment, lost sales and revenue and damage to our reputation in the market, all of which would harm our business and results of operations. In addition, because our purchase contracts with contract manufacturers are typically denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates may impact our contract manufacturers who operate in local currency, which may cause our suppliers to seek price concessions on future orders.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9989919066429138}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996337890625}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9972769618034363}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.6922010779380798}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9985184073448181}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.5249313116073608}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9949185252189636}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.998088538646698}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.962904155254364}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9832509160041809}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9986554384231567}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9977298378944397}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995939135551453}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9989026784896851}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9903857707977295}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9986523985862732}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.8784335255622864}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9853528141975403}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9984001517295837}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9886577725410461}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.998047947883606}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9980218410491943}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9961511492729187}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9974070191383362}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.995807409286499}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9962077140808105}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9193712472915649}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995676875114441}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9319556355476379}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9970520734786987}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.8991521000862122}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9988973140716553}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9967449903488159}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9984707236289978}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9982981085777283}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.553924024105072}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9984350800514221}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9939980506896973}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9984096884727478}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9945440292358398}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9935134053230286}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999037504196167}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9987080097198486}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999474823474884}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9987265467643738}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.762065052986145}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9953047037124634}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.7338315844535828}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992539286613464}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9931865930557251}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9973471164703369}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9987612962722778}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.998449444770813}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9970009922981262}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992417097091675}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9505249261856079}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9985673427581787}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.989590585231781}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9981308579444885}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9981396198272705}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9939760565757751}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9982815980911255}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9975162744522095}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9227166175842285}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9338005781173706}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995167255401611}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9989621639251709}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9969738721847534}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9982981085777283}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9902352690696716}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9577244520187378}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9978246688842773}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.998641312122345}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9984956979751587}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9971752166748047}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9776501655578613}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9986075758934021}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.8921905159950256}], "sentiment": "negative"}, "item 9.01": {"text": "Financial Statements and Exhibits.

On December 1, 2025, United Rentals (North America), Inc. (\"URNA\") completed an offering of $1,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.375% Senior Notes due 2033 (the \"Notes\") in a private placement to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), or outside the United States to certain persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of December 1, 2025 (the \"Indenture\"), among URNA, United Rentals, Inc. (\"URI\"), certain domestic subsidiaries of URNA (the \"Subsidiary Guarantors\" and, together with URI, the \"Guarantors\"), and Truist Bank, as trustee. The Notes mature on November 15, 2033 and bear interest at a rate of 5.375% per year payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The first such interest payment will be made on May 15, 2026. The Notes are senior obligations of URNA and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior indebtedness, effectively junior to any of its existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of its existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantors. The guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the Guarantors and rank equally in right of payment with all of their existing and future senior indebtedness, effectively junior to any of their existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness. The Notes are not guaranteed by URNA's foreign subsidiaries or unrestricted subsidiaries. URNA may redeem some or all of the Notes, at its option, at any time on or after November 15, 2028, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on November 15 of each of the years indicated below: Year Redemption Price 2028 102.688 % 2029 101.344 % 2030 and thereafter 100.000 % Year Redemption Price Year Redemption Price 2028 102.688 % 2028 102.688 % 2029 101.344 % 2029 101.344 2030 and thereafter 100.000 % 2030 and thereafter 100.000 At any time prior to November 15, 2028, URNA may, at its option, redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus a \"make-whole\" premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, at any time on or prior to November 15, 2028, URNA may, at its option, on one or more occasions, redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a price equal to 105.375% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events during a period when the change of control offer to purchase provisions under the Indenture apply, URNA must offer to repurchase the Notes at a price of 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. The Indenture governing the Notes contains certain covenants applicable to URNA and its restricted subsidiaries, including limitations on liens and mergers, consolidations and sale of assets. The Indenture governing the Notes also contains requirements relating to additional subsidiary guarantors. Each of these covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications. In addition, the requirements to provide subsidiary guarantees and to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control will not apply to URNA and its restricted subsidiaries during any period when the Notes are rated investment grade by at least two of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by URNA, provided at such time no default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing. The Indenture provides for customary events of default, including the following (subject to any applicable cure period): nonpayment, breach of covenants in the Indenture, payment defaults under or acceleration of certain other indebtedness, failure to discharge certain judgments and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization. If an event of default occurs or is continuing, the trustee, acting at the direction of holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to be due and payable immediately.

(NASDAQ: AAON) (\"AAON\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in high-performance and energy-efficient HVAC solutions, announced the promotion of Doug Wichman to executive vice president and general manager of its AAON Business Unit effective January 1, 2026. In this role, Wichman will lead the teams responsible for translation of corporate objectives into strategic business plans, development and implementation of product roadmaps, oversight of engineering and R&D for semi-custom HVAC solutions, and provision of technical support to channel partners and end-users. Wichman also will collaborate with leaders in sales and operations on the marketing and sale of AAON systems, production of systems to meet customer demand, and procurement of materials and components needed for configurable systems. Wichman succeeds longtime AAON- and industry-leader Stephen Wakefield, who is moving into an exclusive consultancy role with the Company as an AAON Fellow and principal engineering advisor, also effective January 1. \"We are excited for Doug to take on this role at AAON,\" said Matt Tobolski, AAON president and CEO. \"Doug's professional growth during the past 13 years epitomizes the opportunity our company provides for team members. With each new assignment, Doug has expanded his technical knowledge and his leadership abilities, making him the right person to succeed Stephen Wakefield. All of us on the leadership team are thrilled Stephen has graciously agreed to serve as an ongoing consultant for our organization even while he enjoys more time with his family.\" Wichman started with AAON in 2012 as a production and manufacturing engineer based in Tulsa. He eventually became plant manager and director of manufacturing before relocating to Texas four years ago to lead AAON's Longview facility. This past fall, Wichman returned to Tulsa to work alongside Wakefield as the vice president of business strategy and performance for the AAON Business Unit. \"In my tenure with AAON I have had the privilege to learn, experience, and lead many facets of the business as well as many talented teams,\" Wichman said. \"Collaboration, innovation, and a sense of fearlessness have been core to our success. The individuals within our organization exemplify industry-leading talent and fuel the trajectory we are on. Leveraging this talent, building collaborative relationships, and staying true to innovation will be key to our future.\" That future will continue to be shaped by Stephen Wakefield, who will draw upon more than 25 years of experience across all aspects of operations, engineering, and product design in his new role as principal engineering advisor. \"AAON has long been defined by grit, great ideas, and the determination to push through challenges,\" Wakefield said. \"The growth and evolution we've seen especially in the past few years are the product of those ingredients. Doug has those exact same qualities, and I look forward to continuing to support him and the entire AAON organization in the years ahead.\" About AAON Founded in 1988, AAON is a world leader in HVAC solutions for commercial and industrial indoor environments.
