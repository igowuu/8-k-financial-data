Worksport completes final stage of execution with launch, adding new, larger revenue stream opportunities and broader global markets for solar power generation and energy storage. West Seneca, New York, December 01, 2025 - Worksport Ltd. (NASDAQ: WKSP) (\"Worksport\" or the \"Company\"), a U.S.-based innovator in advanced manufacturing, clean energy technologies and automotive accessories, serving both consumer and reseller markets, today announced that its next-generation Nano-Grid power system for pickup truck beds has now officially launched and is available for purchase , marking one of the most significant commercial milestones in the Company's history. The system combines the CORTM portable battery with the SOLISTM Truck-Mounted Folding Solar Array , creating a compact clean-energy nano-grid that delivers renewable, portable, on-board power for light trucks, overlanding, work sites, emergency backup, and off-grid applications. This launch represents the culmination of years of investment in engineering, field testing, validation, and market preparation. Worksport previously projected $2-3 million in SOLIS + COR revenue for its initial 2025 launch , with 8-figure growth potential in 2026 driven by both consumer and enterprise-scale channels. A Closer Look at the Nano-Grid System Combining two new Worksport products; a seamless, vehicle-mounted clean-power system is created, allowing 60M+ US pick-up trucks to generate, store, and use power anywhere. The first commercially available system of its kind. CORTM Portable Battery System High-capacity modular energy storage (1kWh - 6kWH) Ruggedized, thermally stable design Fast-charge and modular architecture Engineered for real-world mobile use cases Do not need a pickup truck to own this product. Replaces your gas generator. Ideal for Jobsite, Campsite, or Worksite. SOLISTM Solar Tonneau Cover Intelligent, solar-integrated hard-folding cover Made in USA of U.S. and imported parts Generates renewable power directly into the COR Dual-function: secure truck bed + continuous clean-energy source Future Pathway to OEM Integration with direct EV Truck battery charging. Launch pricing previously announced includes SOLIS at $1,999 to $2,499 depending on bed length and the COR Starter Kit at $949 for one HUB and one Battery. What's in the box and why it matters: COR Battery provides about 1 kWh of usable energy (nominal 960 Wh). The COR HUB delivers 1,800 W continuous AC output with up to 2,000 W boost , with four 120 V outlets plus USB-A and USB-C for fast charging. When paired with the largest SOLIS model, a COR Battery can recharge in approximately 2-3 hours under optimal conditions, supporting continuous off-grid operation by cycling batteries. This modular design helps right-size costs while supporting run-rate growth as users add capacity over time. Commercialization at work: To seed launch demand and validate the supply chain, Worksport previously placed an opening purchase order exceeding $1 million covering 900 COR units 600 additional batteries with a Tier 1 global battery manufacturer. SOLIS will launch with 10+ models initially . Management has framed this as a foundational step toward scaling production and revenue as SOLIS and COR enter the market. \"Customers have asked for a clean, quiet alternative to gas generators that is practical for daily life,\" said Steven Rossi, Chief Executive Officer . \"With SOLIS and COR now available to order, Worksport is delivering a portable nano-grid that fits the truck, scales with the user, and creates a growth engine for our energy platform. We believe this launch unlocks new lanes across overlanding, trades, fleets, and emergency readiness while building long-term value for our shareholders.\" Order today and explore specifications and fitments at worksport.com .

Scalable Growth Strategy 3 Government Regulation Aero Velocity is subject to industry-specific regulations governing the operation of UAS. In the United States, its activities are regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"), which oversees the use of the U.S. National Airspace System (\"NAS\") for all air vehicles, including small UAS (\"sUAS\"). In August 2016, the FAA's final rules for the routine commercial use of certain small, unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) weighing less than 55 pounds became effective. These rules establish safety and operational requirements for non-recreational flight, generally mandating visual line-of-sight operations during daylight hours or during twilight with anti-collision lighting, and imposing restrictions on altitude, airspeed, and proximity to persons not directly involved in the operation. The regulations also require aircraft registration, operator certification, marking requirements, and adherence to operational limitations, including prohibitions on flights over unprotected individuals absent specific authorization. Aero Velocity operates under FAA Part 107 regulations employing a team of certified remote pilots who comply with all applicable operational requirements. For missions requiring Operations Over People (\"OOP\"), Over Moving Vehicles, Beyond Visual Line of Sight, or at night, the Company either obtains the necessary FAA waivers or deploys aircraft that are compliant with the applicable FAA operational categories. Aero Velocity's fleet includes aircraft that are compliant with the National Defense Authorization Act, ensuring eligibility for federal procurement and adherence to U.S. national security requirements. In April 2021, the FAA's final rule for Remote Identification (\"Remote ID\") of UAS became effective, alongside updated provisions for operations of sUAS over people. These rules permit certain categories of routine operations over people, moving vehicles, and at night, provided that the aircraft and operation meet specified technical and safety standards. Aero Velocity ensures that all deployed aircraft and flight operations are Remote ID compliant in accordance with applicable FAA deadlines. In addition to U.S. regulations, Aero's international operations are subject to the aviation laws and regulatory requirements of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Such laws may, in some cases, be more stringent than U.S. regulations, particularly with respect to airspace access, equipment certification, and operational approvals. Aero Velocity maintains compliance through active regulatory monitoring, operator training, and fleet configuration tailored to the specific requirements of each jurisdiction. Research and Development Aero Velocity has historically devoted significant resources to the design and development of UAS for manufacturing and deployment in both commercial and defense markets. Aero continues to invest in advancing its platforms, with a particular emphasis on incorporating AI and machine learning technologies to enhance mission execution, data analysis, and operational efficiency. Current research and development initiatives include the application of machine learning algorithms within inspection and monitoring workflows, the development of automated fault detection and predictive maintenance capabilities, as well as advancements in imaging technologies and flight performance. The Company is also creating AI- and machine learningbased analytical solutions for use by its Data Science and Engineering teams, enabling faster, more accurate interpretation of aerial data and improved decision-making for customers. These efforts are intended to maintain Aero Velocity's competitive position, expand its technical capabilities, and address the evolving requirements of its government and commercial client base. Intellectual Property Aero Velocity invests in the protection and development of its intellectual property portfolio, including proprietary processes, designs, and trade secrets related to unmanned aerial systems, data analytics, and drone-powered service delivery. Aero maintains confidentiality agreements with employees, partners, and clients to safeguard its competitive position. 4 Aero Velocity maintains access to and benefits from a portfolio of patents, trademarks, software, and other intellectual property assets originating from its predecessor operations and technology partnerships. This intellectual property supports the Company's service lines, enhances operational efficiency, and strengthens competitive positioning in both commercial and federal markets. Patents The Company's portfolio includes U.S. and international patents providing protection for key innovations in unmanned aerial systems. These protections extend across the United States, Canada, Europe, and Mexico, with several applications pending.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the abbreviated financial statements of Aero Velocity, Inc, (the \"Company\") a former business of Workhorse Group, Inc., which comprise the statements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of June 5, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the related statements of revenues and direct expenses for the period from January 1, 2024 to June 5, 2024 and for the six months ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes to the abbreviated financial statements (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and June 5, 2024, and its revenues and direct expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and the period from January 1, 2024 to June 5, 2024 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Emphasis of Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the financial statements have been prepared for the purposes of complying with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and are not intended to be a complete presentation of the Business' assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and cash flows.

NOTES ABBREVIATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Description of the Transaction On June 6, 2024, the Aero Velocity, Inc. (\"Aero\" or \"the Company\") entered into an agreement with Workhorse Group, Inc. (\"Workhorse\") to purchase the assets of their drone business in exchange for 50% of operating cash flow for the first 12 months following the agreement. No cash was exchanged at the time of the agreement. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations because the acquired assets met the definition of a business, which includes inputs, processes, and outputs capable of generating revenue. Under this agreement, Aero is obligated to pay Workhorse 50% of Aero's operating cash flow for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2025. The payment is contingent upon the operating cash flow (defined as \"revenue paid in cash minus operating expenses paid in cash\" per the agreement) generated during this period and will be due in 2025 pending agreement of the calculation of operating cash flows between Aero. The Company has assessed this obligation and recognizes the potential financial impact in accordance with applicable accounting standards.

The liability will continue to be remeasured at fair value at each reporting date, with changes recognized in earnings.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A summary of the company's significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying abbreviated financial statements follows: Basis Presentation The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP). The Statements of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed and Statements of Revenues and Direct Expenses are prepared for the sole purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and are not intended to be a complete presentation of the Company's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The financial statements have been prepared in an abbreviated format as prior to the divestiture the business was treated as a product line of Workhorse and did not rise to the level of a reportable segment. Under US SEC Regulation S-X 3-05(e), the financial statements of an acquisition of net assets that constitutes a business can be prepared and audited as abbreviated financial statements if the business meets certain qualifying conditions as follows: The total assets and total revenues (both after intercompany eliminations) of the acquired or to be acquired business constitute 20 percent or less of such corresponding amounts of the seller and its subsidiaries consolidated as of and for the most recently completed fiscal year. Separate financial statements business previously prepared; The acquired business was not a separate entity, subsidiary, operating segment (as defined in U.S. GAAP) or division during the periods for which the acquired business financial statements would be required; and The seller has not maintained the distinct and separate accounts necessary to present financial statements that, absent this paragraph , would satisfy the requirements of this section and it is impracticable to prepare such financial statements. The Company meets these qualifying conditions and as a result, it is impracticable to prepare full financial statements as required by Regulation S-X. These abbreviated financial statements may not be indicative of what they would have been had the Company been an independent stand-alone entity, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results of the Company's operations going forward due to the omission of various operating expenses. The Statements of Revenues and Direct Expenses do not include cost of revenues, corporate overhead expense, and interest expense for debt that is not assumed by the new Company given that financial statements of the Company under Workhorse including this information were not available and to include such costs would involve making assumptions. The Company has presented only payroll-related general and administrative expenses due to the unavailability of complete information required to allocate and present other components of general and administrative costs. These financial statements are not intended to present a full depiction of general and administrative expenses under U.S. GAAP and should be read with that limitation in mind. Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the (i) estimates of future costs to complete customer contracts recognized over time, (ii) fair value of assets acquired, and (iii) fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The determination of the timing of revenue recognition and the measurement of the transaction price involves judgments and estimates that may impact the amounts reported. The Company recognizes revenue based on a five-step model when all of the following criteria have been met: (i) a contract with a customer exists, (ii) performance obligations have been identified, (iii) the price to the customer has been determined, (iv) the price to the customer has been allocated to the performance obligations, and (v) performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations under service agreements generally are satisfied over time as the service is provided. Revenue under these contracts is recognized over time using an input measure of progress (typically based on acres scanned to date.) Performance obligations for product sales are typically satisfied at a point in time. This occurs when control of the products is transferred to the customer, which generally is when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. Taxes Collected Customers In the course of doing business, the company collects taxes from customers, including but not limited to sales taxes. It is the company's policy to record these taxes on a net basis in the statement of operations; therefore, the company does not include the taxes collected as a component of revenues. of Revenue Cost of revenue primarily include direct and indirect materials, manufacturing overhead, and shipping and logistics costs. General Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses generally consist of payroll -related costs due to the unavailability of complete information required to allocate and present other components of general and administrative expenses. Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company has a limited number of customers. For the period from January 1, 2024 to June 5, 2024, two customers accounted for approximately 89% of total revenues, with individual customer concentrations of 46% and 43%, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2023, two customers accounted for approximately 86% of total revenues, with individual customer concentrations of 53% and 33%, respectively. Commitments Contingencies From time to time, the Company may be subject to litigation and other claims in the normal course of business. As of June 5, 2024, the Company was not subject to any material commitments or contingencies, including legal proceedings, guarantees, environmental obligations, or other contractual commitments, that would require disclosure under U.S. GAAP, and no amounts have been accrued in the financial statements with respect to any matters. Property Equipment, The property and equipment balance presented herein has been adjusted to reflect only those property and equipment items that were acquired through the acquisition. Property and equipment not transferred as part of the transaction have been excluded from the presented balances. Accumulated depreciation has also been adjusted accordingly to reflect only the acquired assets. Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the assets' estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lives of the respective leases or the services of the improvements. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense in the period in which they are incurred, and betterments are capitalized. 3.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Aero Velocity, Inc. (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024, and the related statement of operations, stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Other Matters Abbreviated financial statements As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the financial statements have been prepared for the purposes of complying with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and are not intended to be a complete presentation of the Business' assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and cash flows. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. Going Concern Management plans to identify adequate sources of funding to provide operating capital for continued growth are disclosed in Note 2. Auditing the Company's assessment and related disclosures regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern required significant auditor judgment. This is due to the high level of uncertainty surrounding the projections and assumptions related to the timing and likelihood of future cash flows, including external funding. Assessing whether the Company's disclosures adequately reflect the uncertainty and risks associated with its going concern status also demanded considerable auditor judgment and effort. We have served as the Company's auditor since 2024. Cypress, Texas August 27, 2025 AERO VELOCITY, INC.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Description of the Business Aero Velocity, Inc. (\"the Company\" or \"Aero\") is a private equity-backed company that emerged from a divesture of Workhorse Group, Inc. (\"Workhorse\") in June 2024, after nearly a decade of operating as Workhorse Aero. On June 6, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Workhorse to purchase the assets of their drone business in exchange for 50% of operating cash flow for the first 12 months following the agreement. No cash was exchanged at the time of the agreement. The acquisition was completed as a part of the divestiture. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations, because the acquired assets met the definition of a business, which includes inputs, processes, and outputs capable of generating revenue. Under this agreement, Aero is obligated to pay Workhorse 50% of Aero's operating cash flow for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2025. The payment is contingent upon the operating cash flow (defined as \"revenue paid in cash minus operating expenses paid in cash\" per the agreement) generated during this period and will be due in 2025 pending agreement of the calculation of operating cash flows between Aero and Workhorse. The Company has assessed this obligation and recognizes the potential financial impact in accordance with applicable accounting standards. At the date of the acquisition, the estimated fair value of the contingent liability was $0 as the projected operating cash flow is expected to be negative. The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the total consideration transferred, resulting in a gain on bargain purchase of $309 thousand, which is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as of the acquisition date. The contingent liability will continue to be remeasured at fair value at each reporting date, with changes recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2024, the estimated value of the contingent liability has not changed and remains at $0 and therefore there are no subsequent changes recognized in earnings. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date: June 6, 2024 Accounts receivable - Workhorse Property and equipment Intangible assets Contract liability Consideration transferred Gain on bargain purchase In connection with the acquisition, the Company measured the identifiable assets acquired and the contingent consideration at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement . Property and equipment and intangible assets acquired were measured using a market approach and considered Level 2 measurements due to the use of observable inputs of equivalent assets, such as market listings for similar assets. The contingent consideration was measured using the twelve-month operating cash flow forecast. The Company is a leading provider of advanced drone services, specializing in lidar and multispectral data acquisition for diverse industries. The Company serves as a trusted partner to its customers, leveraging its expertise in cutting-edge data capture and drone technology solutions developed through collaborations with industry innovators. Aero also provides comprehensive drone maintenance, repair, warranty, and fleet support services, drawing on over 10 years of experience in drone maintenance and manufacturing. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company was established on June 6, 2024 as an acquisition from Workhorse Group, as a result the Statements of Operations and of Cash Flows presented herein represents the activity from the acquisition date to December 31, 2024. The financial information prior to the acquisition date will be presented separately as abbreviated financial statements prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follows: Basis of Presentation accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accept in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"), and in the opinion of management, include all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring adjustments, unless otherwise disclosed) necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity (deficit) for each period presented. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In assessing the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, management has considered the Company's current financial position, future cash flow forecasts, and available financing facilities. While the Company incurred a net loss and had negative operating cash flows during the period from June 6, 2024 to December 31, 2024, subsequent developments including improved recent financial performance, access to additional financing, and continued expansion in operations, have supported the going concern assessment. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that there is no substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date the financial statements are issued. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the (i) estimates of future costs to complete customer contracts recognized over time, (ii) valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets, (iii) fair value of assets acquired, and (iv) fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company classifies all highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits of $250,000. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amounts management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Credit is extended to customers based upon evaluation of the customer's financial condition, and collateral is not required. Management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a General and administrative expense within the Statement of Operations and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the status of individual accounts. Balances still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off from the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2024, there were no allowances for doubtful accounts. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The determination of the timing of revenue recognition and the measurement of the transaction price involves judgments and estimates that may impact the amounts reported. The Company recognizes revenue based on a five-step model when all of the following criteria have been met: (i) a contract with a customer exists, (ii) performance obligations have been identified, (iii) the price to the customer has been determined, (iv) the price to the customer has been allocated to the performance obligations, and (v) performance obligations are satisfied. AERO VELOCITY, INC. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The performance obligations under service agreements generally are satisfied over time as the service is provided. Revenue under these contracts is recognized over time using an input measure of progress (typically based on acres scanned to date.) Performance obligations for product sales are typically satisfied at a point in time. This occurs when control of the products is transferred to the customer, which generally is when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. Taxes Collected from Customers - In the course of doing business, the company collects taxes from customers, including but not limited to sales taxes. It is the Company's policy to record these taxes on a net basis in the statement of operations; therefore, the company does not include the taxes collected as a component of revenues. Cost of revenue Cost of revenue primarily include direct and indirect materials, manufacturing overhead, and shipping and logistics costs. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs as well as fees for professional and contract services. Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company has a limited number of customers. For the period from June 6, 2024 to December 31, 2024, two customers accounted for approximately 90% of total revenues, with individual customer concentrations of 77% and 13%. As of December 31, 2024, three customers accounted for approximately 90% of total accounts receivable, with individual customer concentrations of 48%, 27%, and 15%. Loss of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the Company. Contract Assets and Liabilities Contracts with customers usually stipulate the timing of payment, which is defined by the terms found within the various contracts under which work was performed during the period. Therefore, contract assets and liabilities are created when the timing of costs incurred on work performed does not coincide with the billing terms, which frequently include retention provisions contained in each contract. The Company's balance sheet may present contract assets which would include unbilled revenue associated with contract work that has been completed and billed but not paid by customers, which are presented in accounts receivable.

On June 6, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Workhorse to purchase the assets of their drone business in exchange for 50% of operating cash flow for the first 12 months following the agreement. No cash was exchanged at the time of the agreement. The acquisition was completed as a part of the divestiture. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations, because the acquired assets met the definition of a business, which includes inputs, processes, and outputs capable of generating revenue. Under this agreement, Aero is obligated to pay Workhorse 50% of Aero's operating cash flow for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2025. The payment is contingent upon the operating cash flow (defined as \"revenue paid in cash minus operating expenses paid in cash\" per the agreement) generated during this period and will be due in 2025 pending agreement of the calculation of operating cash flows between Aero and Workhorse. The Company has assessed this obligation and recognizes the potential financial impact in accordance with applicable accounting standards. At the date of the acquisition, the estimated fair value of the contingent liability was $0 as the projected operating cash flow is expected to be negative. The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the total consideration transferred, resulting in a gain on bargain purchase of $309,066, which is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as of the acquisition date. The contingent liability is no longer subject to remeasurement, as the terms have been finalized as of the date the financial statements were issued. As of September 30, 2025, the value of the contingent liability remains at $0. Accordingly, no subsequent changes have been recognized in earnings. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date: June 6, Accounts receivable - Workhorse 120,000 Property and equipment 297,066 Intangible assets 12,000 Contract liability (120,000 Consideration transferred Gain on bargain purchase 309,066 In connection with the acquisition, the Company measured the identifiable assets acquired and the contingent consideration at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement . Property and equipment and intangible assets acquired were measured using a market approach and considered Level 2 measurements due to the use of observable inputs of equivalent assets, such as market listings for similar assets. The contingent consideration was measured using the twelve-month operating cash flow forecast. The Company is a leading provider of advanced drone services, specializing in lidar and multispectral data acquisition for diverse industries. The Company serves as a trusted partner to its customers, leveraging its expertise in cutting-edge data capture and drone technology solutions developed through collaborations with industry innovators. Aero also provides comprehensive drone maintenance, repair, warranty, and fleet support services, drawing on over 10 years of experience in drone maintenance and manufacturing. AERO VELOCITY, INC. NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The accompanying financial statements present the financial position and results of operations of the Company as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. The Company was established on June 6, 2024 as an acquisition from Workhorse. Accordingly, there is no prior comparative interim information presented in accordance with Rule 10-01(b)(1) of Regulation S-X. Management believes the financial information included herein reflects all necessary adjustments and disclosures to fairly present the Company's financial position, results of operations, changes in stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for the periods presented. A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements follows: Basis of Presentation accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accept in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"), and in the opinion of management, include all adjustments (consisting of normal, recurring adjustments, unless otherwise disclosed) necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, and changes in stockholders' deficit for each period presented. Interim Financial Reporting We have prepared these unaudited financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial statements. Accordingly, these statements do not include all information and footnote disclosures required for annual statements, and the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. While we believe the disclosures presented are adequate for interim reporting, these interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. Out of Period Adjustment During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company recorded an out of period adjustment of $15,508 related to our payroll entries that reduced our Liabilities and Expenses related to Cost of Sales and General and Administrative expenses which were incorrectly presented in our 2024 financial statements. The payroll entries in 2024 had coding errors which incorrectly resulted in the recognition of $14,793 of expense related to a 401k program that should have had no impact to the Statement of Operations, as the company did not, and still does not have a company match. In addition, at year end the payroll tax expense had an unreconciled amount of $30,596 which was reversed to Other Accrued Liabilities. It was later determined that the payroll tax amounts were correct and should not have been reversed. The net of these two errors resulted in understated expenses of $15,508 and overstated liabilities for the same amount in 2024. Management identified that the errors were the result of the incorrect setup of the automated entries derived from the payroll vendor processing in 2024 specifically with respect to the treatment of the 401k withholding and the payroll tax remittances, which resulted in errors in the coding of the payroll journals. As of September 30, 2025, the $15,508 reduction to Other Accrued Liabilities remains while there is no additional impact to our Statement of Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025. Management has evaluated the impact of the errors, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and determined that they were not material to the financial statements for the periods ended December 31, 2024, March 31, 2025, June 30, 2025, or September 30, 2025. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In assessing the appropriateness of the going concern assumption, management has considered the Company's current financial position, future cash flow forecasts, and available financing facilities. While the Company incurred net loss and had negative operating cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, subsequent developments including improved recent financial performance, access to additional financing, and continued expansion in operations, have supported the going concern assessment. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that there is no substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date the financial statements are issued. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the (i) estimates of future costs to complete customer contracts recognized over time and (ii) valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. AERO VELOCITY, INC. NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company classifies all highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts, which at times may exceed federally insured limits of $250,000. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amounts management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Credit is extended to customers based upon evaluation of the customer's financial condition, and collateral is not required. Management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to General and administrative expense within the Statement of Operations) and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the status of individual accounts. Balances still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off from the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, there were no allowances for doubtful accounts. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The determination of the timing of revenue recognition and the measurement of the transaction price involves judgments and estimates that may impact the amounts reported. The Company recognizes revenue based on a five-step model when all of the following criteria have been met: (i) a contract with a customer exists, (ii) performance obligations have been identified, (iii) the price to the customer has been determined, (iv) the price to the customer has been allocated to the performance obligations, and (v) performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations under service agreements generally are satisfied over time as the service is provided. Revenue under these contracts is recognized over time using an input measure of progress (typically based on acres scanned to date.) Performance obligations for product sales are typically satisfied at a point in time. This occurs when control of the products is transferred to the customer, which generally is when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. Taxes Collected from Customers - In the course of doing business, the company collects taxes from customers, including but not limited to sales taxes. It is the Company's policy to record these taxes on a net basis in the statement of operations; therefore, the company does not include the taxes collected as a component of revenues. Cost of revenue Cost of revenue primarily include direct and indirect materials, manufacturing overhead, and shipping and logistics costs. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses generally consist of personnel and facilities costs as well as fees for professional and contract services. Concentrations of Credit Risk The Company has a limited number of customers and vendors. For the three months ended September 30, 2025, three customers accounted for approximately 95% of total revenues, with individual customer concentrations of 49%, 36% and 10%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, one customer accounted for approximately 69% of total revenues. As of September 30, 2025, two customers accounted for approximately 97% of total accounts receivable and four vendors accounted for 82% of total accounts payable, with individual vendor concentrations of 43%, 16%, 12%, and 11%. As of December 31, 2024, three customers accounted for approximately 90% of total accounts receivable, with individual customer concentrations of 48%, 27%, and 15%, and two vendors accounted for approximately 81% of total accounts payable, with individual vendor concentrations of 69% and 12%. Loss of these customers or vendors could have a material adverse impact on the Company. AERO VELOCITY, INC. NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Contract Assets and Liabilities Contracts with customers usually stipulate the timing of payment, which is defined by the terms found within the various contracts under which work was performed during the period. Therefore, contract assets and liabilities are created when the timing of costs incurred on work performed does not coincide with the billing terms, which frequently include retention provisions contained in each contract. The Company's balance sheet may present contract assets which would include unbilled revenue associated with contract work that has been completed and billed but not paid by customers, which are presented in accounts receivable. The Company's balance sheets may also present contract liabilities, which contain deferred revenue, which represent amounts received for which revenue has not yet been earned as the service has not yet been provided. Property and Equipment, net Property and equipment, net are carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Certain assets were acquired in accordance with the agreement concluded with Workhorse in June 2024, the value of the acquired assets represents fair value of the assets as of the date of the agreement. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the assets' estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight -line method over the shorter of the remaining lives of the respective leases or the services of the improvements. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense in the period in which they are incurred, and betterments are capitalized if the life of the underlying asset is extended. The cost of assets sold or abandoned, and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the balance sheet and any gains or losses are reflected in the accompanying Statement of Operations of the respective period. Intangible Assets, net Intangible assets include domains and internal use software. Certain of the intangible assets were acquired in accordance with the agreement concluded with Workhorse in June 2024 and the value of the acquired assets represents fair value of the assets as of the date of the agreement. Intangible assets are recognized at cost when acquired or as the accumulation of certain costs when internally developed (in accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software ) and are carried net of accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once placed in service, intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes , which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company recognized income tax benefit along with a partially offsetting income tax expense, resulting from its deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets primarily relate to accrued expenses not yet deductible for tax purposes and net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities primarily related to temporary differences associated with depreciation of property and equipment for tax purposes in excess of book depreciation and the timing of revenue recognition related to deferred revenue. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented net by tax jurisdiction. Net operating loss carryforwards are recognized as deferred tax assets to the extent that realization is considered more likely than not based on expected future taxable income and other available evidence. Company has evaluated the realizability of its deferred tax assets and determined that it is more likely than not that the full amount will be realized based on expected future taxable income and the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recorded as of September 30, 2025. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in judgment occurs. The Company had no material uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. AERO VELOCITY, INC. NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.

The impairment related to acquired domain names that were fully written off during the three month period ended March 31, 2025, as they currently have no commercial use or value, and the Company has no plans to restore or reinstate their usage. As a result, the domains were deemed to have no recoverable amount. The assets were written down to a carrying value of $0, with fair value determined based on management's assessment that no fair value or future economic benefit remains. 6.

99.4 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION On September 2, 2025, BT Brands, Inc. (the \"Parent\", \"BT Brands\" or \"BT\") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Aero Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\"Merger Sub\"), and Aero Velocity Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\" or \"Aero\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the \"Merger\"). The Merger Agreement contemplates the eventual spinoff of BT Group, Inc., the entity holding all of BT Brands' restaurant assets and liabilities, including cash and investments, to BT Brands' stockholders of record eligible to vote at the special meetings being held to consider the merger. Management of BT Group, Inc. plans to pursue a listing for BT Group common stock. The Merger contemplates that, at closing, 89% of the equity ownership will be allocated to Aero shareholders and 11% to BT Brands. At closing, the Parent will issue a total of 10,110 shares of $0.001 par value Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock, with an aggregate stated value of $101,100,000, convertible into common stock at $1.48 per share, representing a total of 68,409,284 common shares. The shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock carry a 50-1 as converted voting preference. The principal stockholder of Aero and its designees have committed to investing $3 million at closing with the option to invest up to $5 million of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Series B Preferred Stock\"). The Pro Forma financial statements reflect a minimum investment of $3 million or 3,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, each with a $0.001 par value and a stated value of $1,000 per share, or $3 million. The Pro Forma statements anticipate the conversion of all Convertible Preferred shares to common stock including Series A-1 and Series A-2 into 68,409,284 common shares and conversion of Series B Preferred Stock into 1,639,344 common shares. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and notes thereto present the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheets as of September 30, 2025 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and the year ended December 31, 2024. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, to give effect to the business combination and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse acquisition, with Aero treated as the accounting acquirer and BT Brands as the accounting acquiree, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations (\"ASC 805\"). As such, the pro forma financial information reflects the assets and liabilities of Aero at historical carrying values and the assets and liabilities of BT Brands measured at estimated fair value as of the assumed acquisition date. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, and the year ended December 31, 2024, give effect to the business combination as if it had occurred on January 1, 2024. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2025, gives effect to the Business Combination as if it had occurred on that date and combines the historical balance sheets of Aero Velocity and BT Brands as of such date. BT Brands' fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Sunday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2024 was a 52-week period that ended on December 29, 2024. The fiscal year to date was the 39 weeks ending September 28, 2025. References in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and notes thereto relate to the 39 and 52-week fiscal periods. The unaudited pro forma financial statements, and the related notes thereto, are based on, and should be read in conjunction with: The historical audited consolidated financial statements of BT Brands as of and for the year ended December 29, 2024, and the related notes, included in BT Brands's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024, filed with the SEC on March 31, 2025; The historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of BT Brands as of and for the 39 weeks ended September 28, 2025, and the related notes, included in BT's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on November 17, 2025; The historical audited abbreviated financial statements of Aero as of June 5, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and for the period ended June 5, 2024, and the six months ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes, included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K; The historical audited financial statements of Aero as of December 31, 2024, and for the period from June 6, 2024, to December 31, 2024, and the related notes, included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K; and The historical unaudited condensed financial statements of Aero for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, and the related notes, included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Company has not completed the detailed valuation study necessary to arrive at the required final estimates of the fair value of the assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed and the related allocations of purchase price. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to adjustment during the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, as the Company finalizes valuations for tangible and intangible assets. As a result of the foregoing, the pro forma adjustments are preliminary and are subject to change as additional information becomes available and as additional analysis is performed. These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are prepared for informational purposes only and are based on assumptions and estimates considered appropriate by management. The unaudited pro forma adjustments represent Aero's and BT Brands' management's estimates based on information available as of the date of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and are subject to change as additional information becomes available and additional analyses are performed. However, management believes that the assumptions provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects that are directly attributable to the business combination, and that the pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions and are properly applied in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not purport to be indicative of what the combined company's financial condition or results of operations would have been if the business combination had been consummated as of the dates indicated, nor do they purport to represent the combined company's financial position or results of operations for future periods.

For BT Brands, amounts are derived from condensed consolidated financial statements included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 28, 2025, and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2024. The historical financial statements of Aero and BT Brands have been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements to give pro forma effect to the accounting for the business combination under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") (\"Pro Forma Transactions Adjustments\"). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and related notes were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, with Aero treated as the acquirer of BT Brands. ASC 805 requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, the estimated preliminary purchase consideration in the business combination has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of BT Brands based upon management's preliminary estimate of their fair values as of the acquisition date. The allocations of the purchase price reflected in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have not been finalized and are based upon the best available information at the current time. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to adjustment during the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, as the Company finalizes valuations for tangible and intangible assets. The completion of the final allocation of the purchase price could cause material differences in the information presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and related notes herein present unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial condition and results of operations of Aero, after giving pro forma effect to the Pro Forma Transactions. The business combination, the Pro Forma Transactions and the related adjustments are described in these accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments have been made that are necessary to present fairly, in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X of the SEC, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not purport to be indicative of the combined company's financial position or results of operations of the combined company that would have occurred if the business combination had been completed on the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the combined company's financial position or results of operations that may be expected for any future period or date. Note 2 Conforming Accounting Policies The accounting policies used in the preparation of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are those set out in Aero's audited financial statements as of December 31, 2024, and for the period then ended and Aero's unaudited condensed financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. During the preparation of this unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, management performed a preliminary analysis of BT Brands's financial information to identify differences in accounting policies as compared to those of Aero. With the information currently available, Aero's management has determined that there were no significant accounting policy differences between Aero and BT Brands and, therefore, no adjustments were made to conform BT Brands's financial statements to the accounting policies used by Aero in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. This conclusion is subject to change, as further assessment will be performed and finalized for purchase accounting purposes. As part of the application of ASC 805, Aero will continue to conduct a more detailed review of BT Brands's accounting policies in an effort to determine if differences in accounting policies require further reclassification or adjustment of BT Brands's results of operations or reclassification or adjustment of assets or liabilities to conform to Aero's accounting policies and classifications. Therefore, Aero may identify additional differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that, when conformed, could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. Note 3 Estimated Consideration and Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect the preliminary allocation of the effectively transferred purchase consideration of $12.5 million to identifiable net assets acquired. The following table summarizes the consideration transferred to acquire BT Brands and preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date: Purchase Price Allocation Assets acquired 11,938,554 Goodwill 4,775,547 Liabilities assumed (4,214,101 Total purchase price 12,500,000 The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and subject to adjustment during the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, as the Company finalizes valuations for tangible and intangible assets. These adjustments may include changes in 1) fair values of property and equipment, 2) changes in allocations to intangible assets such as customer relationships, intellectual property, and goodwill, and 3) other changes to assets and liabilities. Note 4 Adjustments to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements The unaudited pro forma adjustments included in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements are as follows: Balance Sheets The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the Transaction Adjustments column in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheets as of September 30, 2025. All adjustments are based on preliminary assumptions and valuations, which are subject to change. The pro forma adjustments give effect to the Business Combination as if it had occurred as of September 30, 2025, and combine the historical balance sheets of Aero Velocity and BT Brands as of that date. Merger consideration In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, BT Brands' stock in the amount of $12.5 million will be effectively transferred as part of the Merger Consideration. The fair value of consideration is based on the number of equity interests BT Brands will issue to Aero Velocity shareholders in the combined entity, comprised of shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Series A-1 Preferred Stock\"), with a stated value of $11,100,000, and shares of Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Series A-2 Preferred Stock\"), with a stated value of $90,000,000. The shares of A-1 Preferred Stock and A-2 Preferred Stock are convertible into a total of 68,409,284 common shares, representing 89% of the merged company's equity. The shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock are convertible into 7,510,812 common shares and carry a preferential voting right of 50 votes per share calculated on an if-converted basis, subject to a 5% ownership blocker. As a result of the merger and the application of the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, the transaction will give rise to the recognition of goodwill, representing the excess of the total estimated merger consideration over the preliminary fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. The amount of goodwill recognized may change upon completion of the final allocation of the purchase price. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been adjusted to remove BT Brands' historical shareholders' equity including treasury shares, accumulated deficit, and additional paid-in capital prior to the merger. Concurrent financing The Merger Agreement provides for the option to invest up to $5 million at closing, with a minimum investment of $3 million. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet reflects the minimum $3 million investment, the concurrent financing for Series B Preferred Stock shares is presented as an increase to preferred stock and a corresponding increase to cash and cash equivalents. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock are expected to be convertible into an estimated aggregate 1,639,344 common shares. Elimination of BT Brands accumulated deficit Adjustment represents the elimination of the BT Brands accumulated deficit upon consummation of the merger. Transaction costs Adjustment represents the transaction-related costs expected to be incurred. Shares issued to Maxim Group LLC Adjustment represents the shares issued to Maxim Group LLC as compensation for advisory services provided to BT Brands. The value of the shares issued to Maxim is 3.5% of the $101,100,000 merger value of Aero, calculated based on an agreed stock price of $1.83 per share, resulting in the issuance of 1,933,606 common shares with a par value of $0.002 per share. (f) Cancellation of treasury stock Adjustment represents the cancellation of treasury stock upon consummation of the merger. Statements of Operations The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the Transaction Adjustments column in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2025, and the year ended December 31, 2024. All adjustments are based on preliminary assumptions and valuations, which are subject to change.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TC Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Basis for Opinion We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAS\"). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of TC Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiary and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about TC Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiary's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the financial statements are available to be issued. Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of TC Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiary's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements. Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about TC Bancshares, Inc. and Subsidiary's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

TC BANCSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS TC Bancshares, Inc. TC Bancshares, Inc. (the \"Company\") is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia on March 5, 2021, to serve as the holding company for TC Federal Bank (the \"Bank\"). The Company owns 100% of the outstanding stock of the Bank. The Bank is a covered savings association headquartered in Thomasville, Georgia that opened in 1934. The Company was formed as part of the bank holding company reorganization of the Bank, which was completed on July 20, 2021. In connection with the reorganization, the Company sold 4,898,350 shares of its common stock at a price of $10.00 per share to the depositors of the Bank for net proceeds of approximately $49.0 million. On July 21, 2021, the Company's common stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol \"TCBC\". On August 2, 2024, the Company delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market and began trading its shares on the OTC Markets Group, Inc. (OTCQX). In this report, unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer to the Company and the Bank, except if the discussions relate to a period before July 20, 2021, these terms refer solely to the Bank. TC Federal Bank The Bank was organized in 1934 as Thomas County Federal Savings & Loan Association and chartered by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as a mutual savings and loan association owned 100% by its depositors. Effective January 1, 2018, the Bank amended its corporate name to TC Federal Bank. Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations in one-to-four family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate and multi-family loans, acquisition, development and land loans, commercial and industrial loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans. In recent years, we have increased our focus, consistent with what we believe to be conservative underwriting standards, originating higher yielding commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. We conduct our business from our main office in Thomasville, Georgia, as well as additional branch banking locations in Tallahassee and Jacksonville, Florida and in Savannah, Georgia. We also operate two Loan Production Offices (LPOs), one in Tallahassee and a second in Jacksonville, Florida. We provide a variety of financial services to individual and commercial customers in the markets we serve. Our results of our operations are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. We generate non-interest income largely from our customer service fees and the sale of residential mortgages into the secondary market. Our results of operations are also impacted by our level of operating expenses, the provision for credit losses, the impact of federal and state income taxes, the relative levels of interest rates and local and national economic activity. As of December 31, 2024, we had total consolidated assets of $516.0 million, loans, net of the allowance for credit losses and deferred fees, of $404.8 million, total deposits of $428.1 million and stockholders' equity of $77.3 million. NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations: The Bank currently conducts business out of its four branch banking locations as well as its two LPOs. The Bank's primary lending products consist of single-family residential mortgage loans and commercial and multi-family real estate loans. Its deposit products are the primary source of funding. The Bank is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\") and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"). The Bank undergoes periodic examinations by the OCC. The Company is subject to the supervision, examination, and reporting requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \"Federal Reserve\"). Basis of Presentation: The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform, in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and with general practices within the banking industry. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the accounts and transactions of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation process. In preparing financial statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates common to the banking industry that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include, but are not limited to, the determination of the allowance for credit losses and the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of the post-retirement obligation, and valuation allowance associated with the realization of deferred tax assets, which are based on future taxable income. Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and balances due from banks and federal funds sold, all of which mature within 90 days. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve eliminated reserve requirements for depository institutions. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve. Investment Securities: The Company classifies its securities in one of three categories: trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. Trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities for which the Company has the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity. All other securities, not included in trading or held-to-maturity, are classified as available-for-sale. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, all of the Company's securities were classified as available-for-sale. Trading and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on securities available-for-sale are excluded from income and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity until realized. Transfers of securities between categories are recorded at fair value at the date of transfer. The Company evaluates individual available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position by first determining whether the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of the security has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. A credit loss exists when the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is less than the amortized cost basis of the security. In determining whether a credit loss exists, the Company considers the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions related to the security, the industry, or geographic areas, the payment structure of the debt security, failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments, and any changes to the rating of the security. Impairment related to credit losses is recognized through an allowance for credit losses up to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Changes to the allowance are recognized through earnings as a provision for (or a recovery of) credit losses. Impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to the yield. Realized gains and losses for securities classified as available-for-sale are included in income and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities sold. Other Investments: Other investments are carried at cost and consist of Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\"FHLB\") stock, which are held in accordance with certain lender and/or member requirements and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The Bank is required to hold the FHLB stock as a member of the FHLB, and transfer of the stock is substantially restricted. The stock is pledged as collateral for outstanding FHLB advances. In addition, the Company has an investment in a Small Business Administration (SBA) fund, which is held on its books at cost. Loans, Loan Fees and Interest Income on Loans: Loans are stated at the principal amount outstanding, net of the allowance for credit losses. Interest on loans is calculated by using the simple interest method on daily balances of the principal amount outstanding. Accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrower's financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is charged to interest income on loans. Generally, payments on nonaccrual loans are applied to principal. Interest income on certain, well collateralized nonaccrual loans, may be recognized using the cash-basis method of accounting. Loan fees, net of certain origination costs, are deferred and amortized over the lives of the respective loans. Allowance for Credit Losses: The allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") is evaluated on a regular basis and established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. When a loan or portion of a loan is determined to be uncollectible, the portion deemed uncollectible is charged against the allowance and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Portfolio Segmentation (\"Collectively Evaluated Loans\") Portfolio segmentation is defined as the pooling of loans based upon similar risk characteristics such that quantitative methodologies and qualitative adjustment factors for estimating the ACL are constructed for each segment. The Company has identified seven portfolio segments of loans including; real estate residential, real estate home equity, real estate multi-family, real estate commercial, real estate construction and land development, consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans. The ACL for Collectively Evaluated Loans estimate is based upon periodic review of the collectability of the loans quantitatively correlating historical loss experience with reasonable and supportable forecasts using forward looking information. Adjustments to the quantitative evaluation may be made for differences in current or expected qualitative risk characteristics. The Company has determined the nine \"universal\" qualitative adjustments categories prescribed by the 2006 Interagency Policy Statement are appropriate given our markets and pool of loans. These criteria are evaluated quarterly to ensure additional criteria do not need to be added, nor do the ranges assigned to each category need to be changed. The nine factors are as follows: 1. Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses. 2. Changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments. 3. Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans. 4. Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff. 5. Changes in the volume and severity of past-due loans, the volume of non-accrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans. 6. Changes in the quality of the institution's loan review system. 7. Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans. 8. The existence and effect of any concentrations of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations. 9. The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the institution's existing portfolio. Individually Evaluated Loans The Company establishes a specific reserve for individually evaluated loans which do not share similar risk characteristics with the loans included in the collectively evaluated loan pools. These individually evaluated loans are removed from the pooling approach discussed above for the collectively evaluated loan pools, and may include nonaccrual loans, loan modifications to borrowers with financial difficulty, and other loans deemed appropriate by management. Available-for-Sale (\"AFS\") Debt Securities For AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, management first assesses whether (i) the Company intends to sell, or (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either case is affirmative, any previously recognized allowances are charged-off and the security's amortized cost is written down to fair value through income. If neither case is affirmative, the security is evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an ACL is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income. If there were any adjustments to the allowance, they would be reported in the Company's income statement as a component of credit loss expense. AFS securities are charged-off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through income when deemed uncollectible by management or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Accrued Interest Receivable Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 and its related amendments on January 1, 2023, the Company made the following elections regarding accrued interest receivable: Presenting accrued interest receivable balances within another line item on the consolidated balance sheets labeled \"accrued interest receivable and other assets\". Excluding accrued interest receivable that is included in the amortized cost of financing receivables and debt securities from related disclosure requirements. Continuing the Company's policy to write off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income. The write-off of accrued interest on loans typically occurs upon becoming 90 days past due. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Historically, the Company has not experienced uncollectible accrued interest receivable on its investment securities. However, the Company would generally write off accrued interest receivables by reversing interest income if the Company does not reasonably expect to receive payments. Due to the timely manner in which accrued interest receivables are written off, the amounts of such write offs are immaterial. Reserve for Unfunded Commitments The reserve for unfunded commitments (the \"Unfunded Reserve\") represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. However, a liability is not recognized for commitments unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The same segmentation is utilized for off-balance sheet commitments as is applied to the funded loan portfolio. The Unfunded Reserve is recognized as a liability (accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets), with adjustments to the reserve recognized as an expense in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The Unfunded Reserve is determined by estimating expected future fundings, under each segment, and applying to the expected loss rates. Expected future fundings are based on historical averages of funding rates (i.e., the likelihood of draws taken) for each loan segment. We then apply the loss rates that were derived on the funded loan portfolio, by loan segment, to calculate the Unfunded Reserve. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale: The Bank sells mortgage loans for an amount equal to the principal amount of loans with yields to investors based upon current market rates. Realized gains and losses related to loan sales are included in gains on sale of loans and are determined using the specific identification method. For financial reporting purposes, the Bank classifies a portion of its loans as \"Mortgage loans held for sale\". Included in this category are loans which the Bank has the current intent to sell and loans which are available to be sold in the event the Bank determines that loans should be sold to support the Bank's investment and liquidity objectives. Loans included in this category for which the Bank has the current intention to sell are recorded at the lower of the aggregate cost or fair value. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Bank had zero and $289,000, respectively, in loans classified as \"Mortgage loans held for sale.\" Premises and Equipment: Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related asset. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the useful life of the respective asset is charged to income as incurred, whereas significant renewals and improvements are capitalized. The range of estimated useful lives for premises and equipment is: Building and improvements 3 40 years Furniture, automobiles and equipment 3 10 years Leases: ASC 842, \"Leases\" (\"ASC 842\") requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months on its consolidated balance sheet regardless of whether the lease is classified as financing or operating. All of the Company's lessee arrangements are operating leases, being real estate leases for Company facilities. Under these arrangements, the Company records right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities, each of which is based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the risk-free rate practical expedient allowable under ASC 842. Right-of-use assets and the related lease liabilities are reported on separate line items on the consolidated balance sheets. All leases are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet except for leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which the Company elected short-term lease recognition under ASC 842. Lease terms may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features. Many leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to ten years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion. Renewal options which are reasonably certain to be exercised in the future were included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in the \"Occupancy and equipment\" line item in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company does not have any material sublease agreements currently in place. Advertising Costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Other Real Estate Owned: Other real estate owned (\"OREO\") represents properties acquired through or by deed in lieu of loan foreclosure and is initially recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Any write-down to fair value at the time of transfer to OREO is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Costs of improvements are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding other real estate owned and subsequent adjustments to the value are expensed. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company had no OREO on its books. Bank owned life insurance: The Bank has purchased life insurance policies on certain key executives and members of management. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other changes or other amounts due that are probable of settlement. Income Taxes: The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Additionally, this method requires the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. In the event the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities results in deferred tax assets, an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset is required. A valuation allowance is provided for the portion of the deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. The Company currently evaluates income tax positions judged to be uncertain. A loss contingency reserve is accrued if it is probable that the tax position will be challenged, it is probable that the future resolution of the challenge will confirm that a loss has been incurred, and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company and the Bank file consolidated income tax returns, with income tax expense or benefit computed and allocated on a separate return basis. Post-Retirement Defined Benefit Obligation: The Bank accounts for its post-retirement defined benefit obligations under Accounting Standards Codification (\"Codification\" or \"ASC\") Topic 715, Retirement Benefits (\"ASC 715\"). The under or over funded status of the Bank's post-retirement defined benefit obligations are recognized as a liability or asset in the balance sheet. To the extent these obligations are funded, changes in funded status are reflected in other comprehensive income. Net actuarial gains and losses and adjustments to prior service costs that are not recorded as components of the net periodic benefit cost are charged to other comprehensive income. Employee Stock Ownership Plan: The Company sponsors an employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") that covers all employees who meet certain service requirements. The Company will make annual contributions to the ESOP in amounts as defined by the plan document. These contributions are used to pay debt service and purchase additional shares. Certain ESOP shares are pledged as collateral for debt. As the debt is repaid, shares are released from collateral and allocated to active employees, based on the proportion of debt service paid in the year. In connection with the Company's initial public stock offering, the ESOP borrowed $3.9 million payable to the Company for the purpose of purchasing shares of the Company's common stock. A total of 391,868 shares were purchased with the loan proceeds. The residual balance of unearned ESOP shares are reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity on the Company's balance sheet. Equity Incentive Plan: On September 21, 2022, the Company's stockholders approved the TC Bancshares, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (\"Equity Plan\") which provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and other equity awards to our officers, employees, directors, advisors, and consultants. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 40,000 options were granted under the Equity Plan, while no stock options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, 16,000 restricted stock awards were granted during the year ended December 31, 2024, while no restricted stock awards were granted for the year ended December 31, 2023. During each of the years that ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, there were 30,998 restricted stock awards that vested, and there were 77,996 unvested as of December 31, 2024. Stock Based Compensation: The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plan using a fair value-based method of accounting, whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606 focuses on revenues from contracts earned over time. Fee income is generally earned over a short period of time, such as monthly, or is earned concurrently with a specific transaction. The Company records a gain or loss from the sale of other real estate owned (\"OREO\") when control of the property transfers to the buyer, which generally occurs at the time of an executed deed. There are no ASC Topic 606 implications unless the Company finances the sale of the OREO property. ASC Topic 606 could change the timing of revenue recognition in the case of seller financing. The Company's other revenue streams are outside the scope of ASC Topic 606. Comprehensive Income: The Company has elected to present comprehensive income in a separate statement of comprehensive income. Accumulated other comprehensive income includes the net of tax effect of unrealized gains (losses) on securities available-for-sale and the unfunded post-retirement benefit obligation of the Company's defined benefit plans. Treasury Stock: Treasury stock is accounted for by the cost method. Subsequent reissuances are accounted for at average cost. It is the current practice of the Company to retire shares as they are repurchased. See Note 15 for further discussion. Earnings per Share: Basic earnings per share represents income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in a manner similar to that of basic earnings per share except that the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include the number of incremental commons shares (computed using the treasury method) that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were issued during the period. Unallocated employee stock ownership plan shares are not deemed outstanding for earnings per share calculations. Reclassifications: Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Subsequent Events: We have evaluated subsequent events through March 12, 2025, which is the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. As of March 12, 2025, there were no material reportable subsequent events.

The unrealized losses on the debt securities arose due to changing interest rates and market conditions and are considered to be temporary because of acceptable investment grades or the repayment sources of principal and interest are backed by government entities. At December 31, 2024, the Company held a total of 91 individual positions in its AFS bond portfolio, of which 82 obligations contained unrealized losses. At December 31, 2023, 47 of the 49 individual securities contained unrealized losses. The Bank does not intend to sell the investments and it is not likely that the Bank will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. The following table presents the number and aggregate depreciation from the Bank's amortized cost basis of debt securities available-for-sale in an unrealized loss position by security type at December 31, 2024: Number of Aggregate Securities Depreciation US treasuries Mortgage-backed securities Collateralized mortgage obligations Municipal bonds -13.5 Corporate obligations -12.8 Total As of December 31, 2024, no ACL has been recognized on AFS securities in an unrealized loss position as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. This is based upon our analysis of the underlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our AFS securities and in consideration of our historical credit loss experience and internal forecasts. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. Furthermore, management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as AFS in the table above and believes that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The unrealized losses are due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, accrued interest on investment securities was approximately $303,000 and $214,000, respectively. The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities available-for-sale at December 31, 2024, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Amortized Estimated Fair Value Investment securities with maturities: Within 1 year 1 to 5 years 9,815,785 8,867,255 5 to 10 years 8,501,247 7,368,346 Over 10 years Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 57,624,836 55,755,216 Total 75,941,868 71,990,817 The Bank did not sell any available-for-sale investment securities during 2024 or 2023. Securities with market values of approximately $2.3 million and $2.0 million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits. NOTE 4 LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES Major classifications of loans, by purpose code, at December 31, 2024, and 2023, are summarized as follows: December 31, 2024 Percent December 31, 2023 Percent Real estate loans: Residential 153,259,888 37.28 148,533,603 39.29 Home equity 11,650,618 11,099,027 Multi-family 16,673,369 19,137,789 Commercial 152,758,191 37.16 123,572,774 32.69 Construction and land development 47,795,940 11.63 55,461,430 14.67 Total real estate loans 382,138,006 357,804,623 Consumer loans 8,496,548 3,345,453 Commercial and industrial loans 20,435,461 16,918,558 Total loans 411,070,015 100.00 378,068,634 100.00 Less: Allowance for credit losses 5,151,886 4,836,878 Deferred loan fees 1,109,616 1,168,666 Loans, net 404,808,513 372,063,090 The Company grants loans and extensions of credit to individuals, as well as a variety of firms and corporations throughout its footprint. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is collateralized by improved and unimproved real estate and is dependent on the real estate market. The Company has divided the loan portfolio into seven portfolio segments, each with different risk characteristics and methodologies for assessing risk. The portfolio segments identified by the Company are real estate residential, real estate home equity, real estate multi-family, real estate commercial, real estate construction and land development, consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans. Real Estate Residential: The Company originates residential real estate loans for the purchase or refinancing of a mortgage. These loans are primarily collateralized by owner-occupied properties and rental properties located primarily in the Company's market areas. Real Estate Home Equity: The Company originates home equity real estate loans to provide home equity lines of credit and closed-end home equity loans. These loans are primarily collateralized by owner-occupied properties located primarily in the Company's market areas. Real Estate Multi-family: Multi-family loans consist of loans to finance real estate purchases, refinancings, expansions and improvements to multifamily properties. These loans may be secured by, but are not limited to, first liens on apartments, mobile home parks or other multi-family properties primarily located within the Company's market areas. The Company's underwriting analysis includes credit verification, independent appraisals, a review of the borrower's and borrower's related entities' financial condition, and a detailed analysis of the borrower's underlying cash flows. Multi-family loans are larger than residential or home equity loans and involve greater credit risk. The repayment of these loans largely depends on the results of operations and management of these properties. Adverse economic conditions also affect the repayment ability to a greater extent than residential or home equity real estate loans. Real Estate Commercial: Commercial real estate loans consist of loans to finance real estate purchases, refinancings, expansions and improvements to commercial properties. These loans may be secured by first liens on office buildings, farms, retail and mixed-use properties, churches, warehouses and restaurants primarily located within the Company's market areas. The Company's underwriting analysis includes credit verification, independent appraisals, a review of the borrower's and borrower's related entities' financial condition, and a detailed analysis of the borrower's underlying cash flows. Commercial real estate loans are larger than residential loans and involve greater credit risk. The repayment of these loans largely depends on the results of operations and management of these properties. Adverse economic conditions also affect the repayment ability to a greater extent than residential real estate loans. Real Estate Construction and land development: These loans are made to borrowers to build commercial structures, a primary or secondary residence and, in some cases, to real estate investors to acquire and develop land. These loans are more difficult to evaluate since they are significantly more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions. In addition, these loans possess a higher degree of credit risk since they are made based on estimates of the future worth of a project and the estimated costs required for completion. The Company limits its overall investment in this portfolio segment due both to management's assessment of risk and certain percentage guidance set by the regulatory agencies. Consumer: Consumer loans mainly consist of personal loans, revolving credit plans and other loans. The Company's consumer loans may be uncollateralized and rely on the borrower's income for repayment. Commercial and industrial: Commercial and industrial loans consist generally of business loans and lines of credit to companies in the Company's market area. Commercial and industrial loans are generally used for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture. Such loans are usually collateralized by the financed assets, although a portion may be made on an unsecured basis and contain the guarantee of the business principals. The Company's underwriting analysis consists of a review of the financial statements of the borrower, the lending history of the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business, the value of the collateral, if any, and whether the loan is guaranteed by the principals of the borrower. Commercial and industrial loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business, which makes them of higher risk than residential loans and the collateral securing loans may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, accrued interest on loans was approximately $1.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Allowance for Credit Losses: The Company's estimate of the ACL reflects losses expected over the remaining contractual life of the assets. The following tables present the activity in the ACL by class of loans for year ended December 31, 2024, and 2023.

The WARM method uses a historical average annual charge-off rate containing loss content over a historical lookback period and is used as a foundation for estimating the credit loss reserve for the remaining outstanding balances of loans in a segment at the balance sheet date. The average annual charge-off rate is applied to the contractual term, further adjusted for estimated prepayments, to determine the unadjusted historical charge-off rate. The calculation of the unadjusted historical charge-off rate is then adjusted, using qualitative factors described in Note 2, for current conditions and for reasonable and supportable forecast periods. Qualitative loss factors are based on the Company's judgment of the Company, market, industry or business specific data, differences in loan-specific risk characteristics such as underwriting standards, portfolio mix, risk grades, delinquency level or term. These qualitative factors serve to compensate for additional areas of uncertainty inherent in the portfolio that are not reflected in the Company's historical loss factors. Additionally, the Company has adjusted for changes in expected environmental and economic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values and other relevant factors over the next 12 to 24 months. Management adjusted the historical loss experience for these expectations. No reversion adjustments were necessary, as the starting point for the Company's estimate was a cumulative loss rate covering the expected contractual term of the portfolio. The ACL is measured on a collective segment basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Our loan portfolio is segmented first by the seven portfolio segments described above, and second, by internally identified risk grades (see description below). Consistent forecasts of the loan drivers are used across the loan segments. For loans that do not share general risk characteristics with segments, we estimate a specific reserve on an individual basis. A reserve is recorded when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the discounted estimated cash flows using the loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of collateral for collateral-dependent loans. The Company closely monitors economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate the exposure to credit risk. Key factors tracked by the Company and utilized in evaluating the credit quality of the loan portfolio include trends in delinquency ratios, the level of nonperforming assets, borrower's repayment capacity and collateral coverage.

As of December 31, 2023, there was one nonaccrual commercial and industrial loan with a balance of $680,000 that had a related specific allowance of $70,000. In addition, there was one nonaccrual home equity loan with a balance of $18,000 that had a related specific allowance of $5,000. Loan Restructurings: Due to the removal of the TDR designation, the Company evaluates all loan restructurings according to the accounting guidance for loan modifications to determine if the restructuring results in a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that result in a direct change in the timing or amount of contractual cash flows include situations where there is a principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension, or combinations of the listed modifications. Therefore, the disclosures related to loan restructurings are only for modifications that directly affect cash flows. A loan that is considered a restructured loan may be subject to the individually evaluated loan analysis; otherwise, the restructured loan remains in the appropriate segment in the ACL model and associated reserves are adjusted based on changes in the discounted cash flows resulting from the modification of the restructured loan. For a discussion with respect to reserve calculations regarding individually evaluated loans refer to the Assets Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis section of Note 14, Fair Value Measurement, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company granted three modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. One modification, with a recorded investment of $7,519, for payment deferral. One modification, with a recorded investment of $266,142, for interest rate reduction and payment delay. One modification, with a recorded investment of $2.3 million, for payment delay. These modifications were considered to be in the best interest of all parties involved, as we believe this will allow the customers to fulfill their financial obligations. As of December 31, 2024, these loans had a total outstanding balance of $2.6 million with no specific reserves. None of these loans were past due as of December 31, 2024. In addition, none of the loans that have been modified since the adoption of ASU 2022-02 have defaulted. Credit Quality: The Company categorized loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed on a continuous basis. The Company uses the following definitions for its risk ratings: Special Mention. Evidence of financial deterioration exists, or file documentation is inadequate or not available to determine the borrower's financial status or ability to repay. The loan possesses potential weakness which may, if not reversed or corrected, weaken the credit or inadequately protect the Company's position. Substandard. A well-defined weakness or weaknesses exists that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. The loan is characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful. All of the weaknesses of a substandard loan exist, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses jeopardize the collection and/or liquidation of the debt. Loss exposure, while evident, is not clearly determinable. Special workout negotiations and/or litigation should be initiated. Loss. Considered uncollectible in full and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future. Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be Pass rated loans. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans and origination year is as follows: Amortized cost basis by origination year Revolving Prior Loans Total December 31, 2024: Real estate loans: Residential 9,719,859 14,493,285 57,725,821 24,375,127 10,219,779 33,653,189 1,377,512 151,564,572 Substandard 15,980 585,243 81,583 312,510 700,000 1,695,316 Total residential 9,719,859 14,509,265 58,311,064 24,375,127 10,301,362 33,965,699 2,077,512 153,259,888 YTD Gross Charge-offs Home equity 11,622,674 11,622,674 Substandard 27,944 27,944 Total home equity 11,650,618 11,650,618 YTD Gross Charge-offs Multi-family 353,141 927,023 3,544,553 5,323,003 6,525,649 16,673,369 Substandard Total multi-family 353,141 927,023 3,544,553 5,323,003 6,525,649 16,673,369 YTD Gross Charge-offs Commercial 32,302,379 27,448,151 14,795,415 21,541,820 12,857,794 33,859,676 1,543,945 144,349,180 Special Mention 277,547 2,659,327 2,936,874 Substandard 463,891 2,655,044 2,353,202 5,472,137 Total commercial 32,302,379 27,448,151 15,072,962 22,005,711 15,512,838 36,519,003 3,897,147 152,758,191 YTD Gross Charge-offs Construction and land development Pass 13,953,431 16,774,840 4,169,905 6,873,552 48,331 687,417 4,142,503 46,649,979 Special Mention 1,100,588 1,100,588 Substandard 45,373 45,373 Total construction and land development 13,953,431 16,774,840 5,270,493 6,873,552 48,331 732,790 4,142,503 47,795,940 YTD Gross Charge-offs Total real estate loans 55,975,669 59,085,397 79,581,542 56,798,943 31,185,534 77,743,141 21,767,780 382,138,006 Consumer loans 6,291,425 1,883,252 175,289 47,275 15,548 36,527 47,232 8,496,548 Substandard Total consumer loans 6,291,425 1,883,252 175,289 47,275 15,548 36,527 47,232 8,496,548 YTD Gross Charge-offs 15,912 15,912 Commercial and industrial loans 4,241,714 1,846,027 2,443,201 708,130 861,540 678,403 6,155,764 16,934,779 Special Mention 68,070 41,062 117,745 56,206 17,502 300,982 Substandard 2,332,422 82,542 518,594 266,142 3,199,700 Total commercial and industrial loans 6,642,206 1,969,631 3,079,540 1,030,478 879,042 678,800 6,155,764 20,435,461 YTD Gross Charge-offs 69,660 69,660 68,909,300 62,938,280 82,836,371 57,876,696 32,080,124 78,458,468 27,970,776 411,070,015 YTD Gross Charge-offs 15,912 69,660 85,572 Amortized cost basis by origination year Revolving Prior Loans Total December 31, 2023: Real estate loans: Residential 14,694,776 57,063,833 23,699,662 12,943,574 5,972,902 31,534,700 1,162,823 147,072,270 Substandard 595,374 103,571 103,813 358,575 300,000 1,461,333 Total residential 14,694,776 57,659,207 23,699,662 13,047,145 6,076,715 31,893,275 1,462,823 148,533,603 YTD Gross Charge-offs Home equity 11,051,949 11,051,949 Substandard 47,078 47,078 Total home equity 11,099,027 11,099,027 YTD Gross Charge-offs Multi-family 700,663 954,603 3,763,531 6,310,552 879,044 6,529,396 19,137,789 Substandard Total multi-family 700,663 954,603 3,763,531 6,310,552 879,044 6,529,396 19,137,789 YTD Gross Charge-offs Commercial 21,791,642 15,233,118 24,305,955 13,608,050 19,709,850 20,421,922 74,946 115,145,483 Special Mention 3,605,149 3,605,149 Substandard 491,804 2,742,136 1,588,202 4,822,142 Total commercial 21,791,642 15,233,118 24,797,759 16,350,186 19,709,850 24,027,071 1,663,148 123,572,774 YTD Gross Charge-offs Construction and land development 25,084,297 9,150,217 8,140,282 53,356 31,944 2,118,212 10,821,270 55,399,578 Special Mention 10,416 10,416 Substandard 51,436 51,436 Total construction and land development 25,084,297 9,150,217 8,140,282 53,356 31,944 2,180,064 10,821,270 55,461,430 YTD Gross Charge-offs Total real estate loans 62,271,378 82,997,145 60,401,234 35,761,239 26,697,553 64,629,806 25,046,268 357,804,623 Consumer loans 2,813,398 313,560 68,213 42,768 43,689 23,673 40,152 3,345,453 Substandard Total consumer loans 2,813,398 313,560 68,213 42,768 43,689 23,673 40,152 3,345,453 YTD Gross Charge-offs 28,198 5,681 33,879 Commercial and industrial loans 2,168,653 2,730,858 1,272,875 1,546,208 334,685 881,462 3,589,607 12,524,348 Special Mention 288,188 2,596,029 2,884,217 Substandard 105,369 1,356,088 48,536 1,509,993 Total commercial and industrial loans 2,562,210 4,086,946 3,868,904 1,546,208 334,685 881,462 3,638,143 16,918,558 Gross Charge-offs 77,940 77,940 67,646,986 87,397,651 64,338,351 37,350,215 27,075,927 65,534,941 28,724,563 378,068,634 YTD Gross Charge-offs 28,198 83,621 111,819 There were no loans classified in the \"doubtful\" or \"loss\" risk rating categories for either of the periods ended December 31, 2024, or 2023.

There were no borrowings against either of these facilities at December 31, 2024, or 2023. The available borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank is collateralized by a blanket lien on certain loans with a carrying value of approximately $65.8 million and $35.2 million at December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. NOTE 9 INCOME TAXES The components of income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, are as follows: Current Alternative minimum tax 2,574 (4,856 Deferred (97,765 (128,075 Utilization of operating loss carryforward 354,372 264,776 Change in valuation allowance (73,262 (23,615 185,919 108,230 The difference between the actual income tax expense and the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, is as follows: Pretax income at statutory rate 163,941 78,552 Add (deduct): State income tax expense, net of federal benefit 30,404 10,465 Tax-exempt income (68,742 (60,137 Stock based compensation 93,997 36,537 Change in valuation allowance (23,615 Other (33,681 66,428 185,919 108,230 The following summarizes the sources and expected tax consequences of future taxable deductions or income, which comprise the net deferred tax asset, which is included as a component of other assets at December 31, 2024, and 2023: Deferred income tax assets: Deferred compensation 477,858 418,877 Net operating loss carryforward 99,930 454,302 Charitable contributions 25,092 State tax credits 71,732 144,994 Defined benefit plan 114,854 Accrued bonuses 68,627 74,274 Non-accrual loans 80,323 78,240 Frozen pension accrual (tax qualified) 239,947 275,052 Unrealized loss on investment securities available-for-sale 1,004,357 976,819 Right of use asset/lease liability 44,260 40,052 Allowance for credit losses 1,421 15,655 Unfunded loan commitments 114,532 35,536 Other 82,763 25,314 Total gross deferred tax assets 2,310,842 2,653,969 Less: Valuation allowance (71,732 (144,994 Net deferred tax asset 2,239,110 2,508,975 Deferred income tax liabilities: Premises and equipment 37,586 12,331 Defined benefit plan 100,314 Director fee plan 23,821 27,708 Other 24,389 Total gross deferred tax liabilities 161,721 64,428 Net deferred tax asset 2,077,389 2,444,547 The future tax consequences of the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities resulted in a net deferred tax asset. A valuation allowance in the amount of approximately $72,000 and $145,000 as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively was established as these deferred tax assets relate to state tax credit carryforwards that will likely expire prior to realization. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $616,000 and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.7 million, which will begin to expire in 2035 unless previously utilized. NOTE 10 COMMITMENTS Credit Related Financial Instruments: In the normal course of business the Company is party to off-balance financial instruments to help meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The contractual amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. In most cases, the Company requires collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk: Commitments to extend credit 60,631,000 47,871,000 Stand-by letters of credit 609,000 719,000 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company, upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation. Collateral held varies, but may include unimproved and improved real estate, certificates of deposit, or personal property. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to businesses within the Company's trade area. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company holds real estate and assignments of deposit accounts as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. The extent of collateral held for these commitments at December 31, 2024, and 2023, varies. The Company maintain an ACL on unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the ACL for loans, modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment. The ACL on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within other liabilities, while the corresponding provision for these credit losses is recorded as a component of other expense. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was $450,000 and $140,000 at December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The following table presents the balance and activity in the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments for the year ended December 31, 2024. Allowance for Credit Losses Unfunded Commitments Balance, December 31, 2023 140,000 Provision for unfunded commitments 310,000 Balance, December 31, 2024 450,000 NOTE 11 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS In the normal course of business, officers and directors of the Company and the Bank, and certain business organizations and individuals associated with them, maintain a variety of relationships with the Bank. Transactions with officers and directors are made on terms comparable to those available to other Bank customers. At December 31, 2024, and 2023, deposits from directors, executive officers, and their related interests aggregated approximately $3.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The following summary reflects related party loan activity during 2024 and 2023. Beginning balance 450,277 493,989 New loans and advancements 296,688 Repayments (140,479 (43,712 Ending Balance 606,486 450,277 NOTE 12 REGULATORY MATTERS The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank's financial statements. Under certain adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total common equity Tier 1, total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes, as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, that the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth below. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution's category. The Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios, and minimum amounts under current regulatory standards, as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, are presented in the following table: To Be Well For Capital Capitalized Under Adequacy Prompt Corrective Actual Purposes Action Provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in Thousands) December 31, 2024: Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk- Weighted Assets 70,650 18.20 17,471 25,236 Total Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 75,512 19.45 31,060 38,824 10.00 Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 70,650 18.20 23,295 31,060 Tier I Capital to Average Assets 70,650 13.64 20,724 25,905 December 31, 2023: Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk- Weighted Assets 68,463 19.71 15,631 22,578 Total Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 72,812 20.96 27,788 34,735 10.00 Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 68,463 19.71 20,841 27,788 Tier I Capital to Average Assets 68,463 15.16 18,068 22,585 NOTE 13 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 401(k): The Bank sponsors a 401(k) plan. The 401(k) plan covers substantially all employees and provides for an employer matching contribution based on a percentage of salary contributed to the plan. The Bank contributed approximately $220,000 and $169,000 to the 401(k) plan during 2024 and 2023, respectively. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans: During 2019, the Bank entered into supplemental executive retirement agreements (each, a \"SERP\") with certain of its officers whereby a specified monthly benefit is payable upon a normal retirement for a period of 10 years. Each SERP is a nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement that conditions payment of the full normal retirement benefit upon an officer's attaining normal retirement age while in the service of the Bank. Otherwise, the retirement benefit is earned over time and, with the exception of the SERPs for a former and a current executive officer, is subject to a ten-year vesting schedule. Moreover, the amount and timing of payment of the retirement benefit may vary depending upon the circumstances of an officer's earlier termination of employment, including death, disability, or in connection with a change in control. The retirement benefit is forfeited in the event of a termination of employment for cause or if grounds exist for such a termination. The earnings on life insurance policies owned by the Bank partially offset the expenses associated with the offering of the SERPs and other employee benefits. The cash surrender value on these insurance policies was approximately $12.1 million and $11.7 million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Bank has recorded a liability for the present value of the future retirement benefits of approximately $980,000 and $876,000, respectively, to be paid under the SERPs. Expense for the SERPs was approximately $104,000 and $183,000 for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. In determining the SERPs obligation for 2024, and 2023, the discount rate used was 4.00%. Director Deferred Fee Practice: The Bank has maintained a discretionary practice of paying a retirement benefit to eligible non-employee directors who attain at least age 70 in the service of the Bank with at least 15 years of service to their credit. Under this practice, each eligible retired director received a monthly benefit in the amount of $825. In anticipation of the Reorganization, the Bank decided to formalize and revise this practice in 2020. The Bank has relinquished its discretion over the practice with respect to eligible retired directors and current non-employee directors who satisfied the eligibility criteria for the benefit as of December 31, 2019. The normal retirement benefit for this group will be a monthly benefit in the amount of $825 a month for the remaining life of the director. With respect to all other non-employee directors serving as of December 31, 2019, the amount of the normal monthly benefit will remain unchanged, but will be paid over a period of 10 years following retirement or, if less, the director's remaining lifetime. The eligibility criteria for this group has been changed to the attainment of at least age 65 with at least 10 years of service. No future non-employee director will be eligible for a benefit under this formalized plan. The Bank has recorded and will continue to record a liability for these payments as post-retirement defined benefit obligations. The Bank recognized current year expense of $25,000 and $30,000 during the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Bank had a projected defined benefit obligation of approximately $426,000 and $415,000, respectively, assuming the continuation of its then existing practice. The discount rate used in determining the accumulated post-retirement defined benefit obligation was 5.14% in 2024, and 4.54% in 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $71,000 included in other comprehensive income associated with this plan. Tax-Qualified Frozen Defined Benefit Pension Plan: The Bank also sponsors a tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plan. Effective March 31, 2019, eligibility for the plan was frozen so that no employee who was not then a participant in the plan could later become a participant and to freeze benefit accruals for all existing participants. For existing participants, the plan provides for retirement payments based on a formula using a participant's years of creditable service and highest three years of annual compensation. Retirees age 66 and older are also eligible for an annual supplemental payment equal to one percent of their monthly benefit multiplied by the number of their retirement years beyond age 65. Participants who entered the plan prior to July 1, 1983, are also eligible for a one-time lump sum payment upon retirement after reaching age 55 equal to three times their monthly retirement benefit. A participant is also required to vest in any benefit earned under the plan formula by completing a minimum number of years of vesting service. The plan also provides for disability benefits and surviving spouse benefits in circumstances where the normal retirement benefit would not otherwise be payable. The following is a summary of the components of the net periodic post-retirement benefit cost (benefit) during 2024 and 2023: Interest cost 405,576 424,632 Expected return on assets (545,187 (422,738 Amortization of unrecognized loss 25,224 Periodicpost-retirement(benefit)cost (139,611 27,118 The discount rate used in determining the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was 5.44% and 4.77% in 2024, and 2023, respectively. The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 7.00% during 2024, and 2023. There was no assumed rate of salary increase used in measuring the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation during 2024, or 2023. The Bank expects the plan to generate approximately $147,000 of periodic pension income during 2025. The following table presents the estimated benefit payments for each of the next five years and in the aggregate for the five years thereafter as of December 31, 2024: 572,373 576,221 573,138 571,986 567,873 2030 2034 2,710,631 5,572,222 Tax-Qualified Frozen Defined Benefit Pension Plan (Continued): The following is a reconciliation of the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024, and 2023: Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year 8,785,685 8,855,122 Interest cost 405,576 424,632 Actuarial (gain) loss (528,002 86,414 Benefits paid (564,940 (580,483 Projected benefit obligation at end of year 8,098,319 8,785,685 following is a summary of the change in plan assets during 2024, and 2023: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 8,100,424 7,369,637 Actual return on assets 938,619 1,196,133 Employer contributions 84,256 172,752 Administrative expenses (65,897 (57,615 Benefits paid, net (564,940 (580,483 Fair value of plan assets at end of year 8,492,462 8,100,424 The fair values of the Bank's pension plan assets at December 31, 2024, and 2023, by asset category, are as follows: Assets Measured Fair Value Measurements at Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 December 31, 2024: Cash and cash equivalents 36,868 36,868 Debt securities mutual funds 2,599,414 2,599,414 Equity securities mutual funds 5,856,180 5,856,180 8,492,462 8,492,462 December 31, 2023: Cash and cash equivalents 80,325 80,325 Debt securities mutual funds 2,556,666 2,556,666 Equity securities mutual funds 5,463,433 5,463,433 8,100,424 8,100,424 The fair value of all pension assets are determined from quoted market prices and are considered Level 1 fair value measurements. The plan's investment policy includes various guidelines and procedures designed to ensure assets are invested in a manner necessary to meet expected future benefits earned by participants. The investment guidelines consider a broad range of economic conditions. Central to the policy are target allocation ranges by major asset categories. The objectives of the target allocations are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify risk through prudent asset allocation parameters, achieve asset returns that meet or exceed the plan's actuarial assumptions and achieve asset returns that are competitive with like institutions employing similar investment strategies. Tax-Qualified Frozen Defined Benefit Pension Plan (Continued): The following is a summary of the amount recognized in other liabilities as of December 31, 2024, and 2023: Projected benefit obligation at end of year 8,098,319 8,785,685 Fair value of plan assets at end of year (8,492,462 (8,100,424 Net pension (asset) liability (394,143 685,261 Amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, were: Net income (loss) 398,864 (456,673 Total accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 398,864 (456,673 Amounts recognized in the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation and other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, were: Net gain (855,537 (629,366 Amortization of net unrecognized loss (25,224 Total recognized in other comprehensive income (855,537 (654,590 Employee Stock Ownership Plan: As part of the Company's initial stock offering, the Company established the TC Federal Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") to provide eligible employees of the Company the opportunity to own Company stock. The ESOP is a tax-qualified retirement plan for the benefit of Company employees. Contributions are allocated to eligible participants on the basis of compensation, subject to federal limits. The Company uses the principal and interest method to determine the release of shares amounts. The number of shares committed to be released per year through 2040 is 19,593. The ESOP funded its purchase of 391,868 shares through a loan from the Company equal to 100% of the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The ESOP trustee will repay the loan principally through the Bank's contributions to the ESOP over the remaining loan term of 16 years. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the remaining principal balance on the ESOP debt was $3.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively. Dividends and other earnings on shares are used for debt service. Under applicable accounting requirements, the Company records compensation expense for the ESOP equal to the fair market value of shares when they are committed to be released from the suspense account to participants' accounts under the plan. Total compensation expense recognized in connection with the ESOP for the year ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 was approximately $296,000 and $233,000, respectively. Shares held by the ESOP include the following: Allocated 73,983 58,592 Committed to be allocated Unallocated 313,495 333,088 Total 387,478 391,680 The market value of unallocated shares was approximately $5.3 million and $4.6 million at December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Equity Plan: On September 21, 2022, the Company's stockholders approved the TC Bancshares, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (\"Equity Plan\"), which authorizes the issuance of up to 700,000 shares of the Company's common stock. This plan allows for the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and other equity awards to its officers, employees, directors, advisors and consultants. Stock options time-vest over a four to five year period and have been fair valued as of the date of the grant. A summary of stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 is presented below: Weighted Average Weighted Average Number of Grant Number of Grant Options Date Fair Value Options Date Fair Value Stock Options Outstanding at beginning of year 357,510 357,510 Granted 40,000 Exercised Forfeited Outstanding at end of year 397,510 357,510 Exercisable at end of year 214,506 143,004 For the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company recognized $319,000 and $226,000, respectively, in compensation cost related to stock options, which is included in salaries and employee benefits expense for our associates and in other noninterest expense for our directors in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2024, there was $727,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a period of four and one-half years. The estimated fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, was determined as of the date of the grant, using the Black-Scholes options pricing model, under the following assumptions: Average-risk-free interest rate Expected life in years Expected dividend yield Expected stock volatility 25.82 Restricted stock awards time-vest over a four or five year period and have been fair valued as of the date of the grant. A summary of restricted stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, is presented below: Number of Weighted Average Number of Weighted Average shares Grant Date Fair Value shares Grant Date Fair Value Restricted Stock Awards Outstanding at beginning of year 92,994 14.85 123,992 14.85 Granted 16,000 13.78 Vested (30,998 14.85 (30,998 14.85 Forfeited Outstanding at end of year 77,996 14.63 92,994 14.85 For the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company recognized $497,000 and $485,000, respectively, in compensation cost related to restricted stock awards, which is included in salaries and employee benefits expense for our associates and in other noninterest expense for our directors in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2024, there was $1.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a period of four and one-half years. For our associates, the terms of the restricted stock agreements permit the surrender of shares to the Company upon vesting in order to satisfy applicable tax withholding burdens, and accordingly 6,567 and 6,175 shares were surrendered during 2024, and 2023, respectively. NOTE 14 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. From time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans and other real estate owned. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of the lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Additionally, the Company is required to disclose, but not record, the fair value of other financial instruments. Fair Value Hierarchy The Company groups assets at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: Level 1 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2 Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3 Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset. Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. Assets Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis. The table below presents the recorded amount of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, all of which consisted of investment securities available-for-sale: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total December 31, 2024: US treasuries 4,601,504 4,601,504 1,337,602 1,337,602 Mortgage-backed securities 41,431,635 41,431,635 Collateralized mortgage obligations 14,323,581 14,323,581 Municipal bonds 7,571,314 7,571,314 Corporate obligations 2,725,181 2,725,181 Investment securities available-for-sale 71,990,817 71,990,817 December 31, 2023: US treasuries 9,533,835 9,533,835 Mortgage-backed securities 9,412,836 9,412,836 Collateralized mortgage obligations 13,953,851 13,953,851 Municipal bonds 7,465,893 7,465,893 Corporate obligations 2,598,080 2,598,080 Investment securities available-for-sale 42,964,495 42,964,495 Assets Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis. The Bank may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are included in the table below as of December 31, 2024, and 2023: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total December 31, 2024: Other real estate owned Individually evaluated loans December 31, 2023: Other real estate owned Individually evaluated loans 623,301 623,301 623,301 623,301 The following tables show significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 assets: Weighted Average Fair Value Valuation Technique Unobservable Inputs Discount December 31, 2024: Other real estate owned Third party appraisals and sales contracts Collateral values, market discounts and estimated costs to sell Individually evaluated loans Third party appraisals and discounted cash flows Collateral values, market discounts and estimated costs to sell December 31, 2023: Other real estate owned Third party appraisals and sales contracts Collateral values, market discounts and estimated costs to sell Individually evaluated loans 623,301 Third party appraisals and discounted cash flows Collateral values, market discounts and estimated costs to sell The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of assets and liabilities either recorded or disclosed at fair value. Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Certificates of deposit with other banks. carrying value of certificates of deposit with other banks is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Investment Securities Available-for-Sale. Investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security's credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange and U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter market funds. Level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by government sponsored enterprises and state, county and municipal bonds. Securities classified as Level 3 include asset-backed securities in less liquid markets. Other Investments. Other investments consist of FHLB and FRB stock as well as an investment in an SBA fund whose carrying value approximates its fair value. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale. The estimated fair value of mortgage loans held for sale, classified within Level 2, is approximated by the carrying value, given the short-term nature of the loans and similarly to what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios of loans with similar characteristics. Loans. The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and a specific allocation is established within the allowance for credit losses. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and/or principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment using one of three methods, including collateral value, market value of similar debt, and discounted cash flows. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. Impaired loans in which an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral require classification in the fair value hierarchy. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price, the Bank records the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is utilized or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the Bank records the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 3. Other Real Estate Owned. Other real estate owned properties are adjusted to fair value less estimated selling costs upon transfer of the loans to other real estate owned. Subsequently, other real estate owned assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value is based on an observable market price, the Bank records the other real estate owned as nonrecurring Level 2. When the fair value is based on an appraised value, or when an appraised value is not available, the Bank records the other real estate owned asset as nonrecurring Level 3. Bank Owned Life Insurance. The carrying value of Bank Owned Life Insurance approximates fair value. Commitments to Extend Credit. Commitments to extend credit are short-term and, therefore, the carrying value and the fair value are considered immaterial for disclosure. Deposits. The fair values disclosed for demand deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (that is, their carrying amounts). The carrying amounts of savings accounts approximate their fair values at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered to a schedule of aggregated expected maturities of time deposits. Federal Home Loan Bank Advances. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are carried at cost and the fair value is obtained from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Bank's financial instruments as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, are as follows: Carrying Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2024 Amount Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 14,232,080 14,232,080 14,232,080 Investment securities available- for-sale 71,990,817 71,990,817 71,990,817 Other investments 1,689,600 1,689,600 1,689,600 Mortgage loans held for sale Loans, net of deferred fees 409,960,399 395,419,000 395,419,000 Bank owned life insurance 12,056,359 12,056,359 12,056,359 Financial liabilities: Deposits 428,098,348 427,752,350 292,385,350 135,367,000 FHLB advances 5,000,000 5,005,078 5,005,078 Carrying Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023 Amount Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 25,039,214 25,039,214 25,039,214 Investment securities available- for-sale 42,964,495 42,964,495 42,964,495 Other investments 1,629,150 1,629,150 1,629,150 Mortgage loans held for sale 289,111 289,111 289,111 Loans, net of deferred fees 376,899,968 366,563,968 366,563,968 Bank owned life insurance 11,729,019 11,729,019 11,729,019 Financial liabilities: Deposits 369,868,794 369,191,794 258,915,942 110,275,852 FHLB advances 11,000,000 11,068,109 11,068,109 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Bank's entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Bank's financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. NOTE 15 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND EARNINGS PER SHARE Stockholders' Equity: On June 27, 2023, the Company announced its second program to repurchase up to 250,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. Then on December 15, 2023, a third plan to repurchase up to 450,000 outstanding shares was announced. Shares may be repurchased on the open market or through private transactions or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The timing and amount of repurchases depends on a number of factors including the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of the stock, alternative uses for capital, and the Company's financial performance. During 2023, 506,358 shares of the Company's common stock was repurchased at an average price of $14.26. During 2024, the Company repurchased an additional 291,619 common shares at an average cost of $13.96. Since beginning share repurchases in 2022, the Company has bought back 873,149 shares of its common stock at an average price of $14.17. All of the shares repurchased by the Company have been retired. Earnings per Share: Earnings per common share was computed based on the following: Numerator: Income applicable to common shares 594,751 265,825 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding 4,234,675 4,783,618 Effect of dilutive securities: Restricted stock 18,638 12,870 Stock options Weighted average common shares outstanding assuming dilution 4,253,313 4,796,488 Earnings per common share Earnings per common share assuming dilution For the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company excluded the effects of outstanding stock options totaling 397,510 and 357,510, respectively, from the computation of diluted earnings per share, as the impact of these potentially dilutive shares from the outstanding stock options would be anti-dilutive.

(\"Colony\") and TC Bancshares, Inc. (\"TCBC\") and are adjusted to give effect to the merger of TCBC with and into Colony on December 1, 2025 (the \"Merger\"). The unaudited pro forma combined consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2025 is presented as if the merger had occurred on September 30, 2025. The unaudited pro forma combined consolidated condensed statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for the nine month period ended September 30, 2025 are presented as if the merger had occurred on January 1, 2024. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information gives effect to the acquisition of TCBC as business combinations under GAAP. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities were recorded at estimated fair value. Pro forma adjustments are included only to the extent they are (i) directly attributable to the acquisition, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) with respect to unaudited pro forma combined consolidated condensed statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The pro forma adjustments are based on estimates made for the purpose of preparing these pro forma statements and are described in the accompanying notes. Colony's management believes that the estimates used in these pro forma financial statements are reasonable under the circumstances. The pro forma adjustments included herein are subject to change as additional information becomes available and additional analyses are performed. The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined after further valuation analyses under GAAP are performed with respect to the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition. The final adjustments may be materially different from the unaudited pro forma adjustments presented herein. In addition, the pro forma financial statements do not include the effects of any potential cost savings which management believes will result from combining certain operating procedures. Colony anticipates that the acquisition of TCBC will provide the combined company with the ability to better serve its customers, reach new customers and reduce operating expenses. In addition, certain subjective estimates have been utilized in determining the pro forma adjustments applied to the historical results of operations of TCBC. The pro forma information, while helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions, does not reflect the benefits of expected cost savings or opportunities to earn additional revenue and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results. It also does not necessarily reflect what the historical results of the combined company would have been had Colony and TCBC been combined during these periods. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is provided for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma combined financial information is not necessarily, and should not be assumed to be, an indication of the results that would have been achieved had the mergers been completed as of the dates indicated or that may be achieved in the future. The preparation of the unaudited pro forma combined financial information and related adjustments required management to make certain assumptions and estimates.

(NASDAQ: SINT) (\"SINTX\" or the \"Company\"), an advanced ceramics and biomaterials company, today announced that it has signed a supply agreement with Evonik Corporation (\"EVONIK\"), a global leader in high-performance polymers, to manufacture the Company's proprietary silicon nitridePEEK compound (SiN/PEEK) (U.S. Patent No. 10,806,831) engineered for AI-assisted additive manufacturing of patient-specific implants that will be produced using equipment already in place at SINTX's U.S.-based production facility. Under the agreement, EVONIK will produce SiN/PEEK compound leveraging its commercial-scale capability to SINTX's specifications, enabling the Company to immediately begin manufacturing AI-designed, 3D-printed, patient-specific implants. SINTX has already received physician requests to provide humanitarian-use vertebral body replacement (VBR) implants for orthopedic and neurosurgical oncology patients following tumor resections in the spine. In addition, the Company intends to use the SiN/PEEK compound to support regulatory clearances of patient matched and traditional subtractive manufactured implantable devices. Eric K. Olson, Chairman, President & CEO of SINTX, said, \"This agreement with EVONIK is another pivotal moment for SINTX and for the field of patient-specific implants. By combining EVONIK's industrial-scale PEEK polymer manufacturing expertise with SINTX's silicon nitride biomaterial manufacturing capabilities, we can deliver next-generation implants that address critical needs in trauma, spine, oncology, and beyond. We believe SiN/PEEK offers compelling advantages over standard PEEK, including antipathogenic surface characteristics, osteogenic potential, and improved visualizationfeatures that matter in complex, high-risk procedures.\" Marc Knebel, head of EVONIK's Medical Devices & Systems market segment, said, \"We are excited to support SINTX in bringing a high-performance SiN/PEEK composite filament to market for additive and subtractive manufacturing of regulated medical devices. This is another example of enabling innovation that EVONIK has delivered to improve medical outcomes. Our collaboration is designed to provide consistent quality, supply reliability, and scalabilityfoundational elements for our continued broader collaboration and data generation to support future medical device market work.\" Why SiN/PEEK for Patient-Specific Implants SINTX's silicon nitride has been studied for its antipathogenic behavior and osteogenic properties, while PEEK composites are valued for radiolucency and mechanical tunability. The SiN/PEEK combination aims to deliver: Antipathogenic surface behavior to help reduce microbial adherence on implant surfaces. Osteogenic support to promote bone on-growth and integration. Improved visualization vs. standard PEEK for intra-operative and post-operative imaging. Design freedom via AI-assisted, additive manufacturing for patient-specific geometries. Scalable, consistent filament to support high-mix, low-volume production typical of patient-specific workflows. With today's supply agreement, the parties envision making SiN/PEEK compound available to other qualified manufacturers for complex implant indications where silicon nitride's attributes may add clinical and economic value. SINTX's near-term humanitarian efforts are focused on trauma and oncology indications for post-tumor resection cases, where surgeons face challenging anatomy and infection risk, and where patient-specific designs may facilitate better fit, fixation and overall clinical outcomes, stated Dr. Ryan Bock, SINTX Chief Technology Officer. \"We're responding to real-world surgeon requests in oncology-related care. Our immediate focus is on humanitarian-use cases while we build the quality systems, regulatory files, and production capacity to expand into additional indications through appropriate FDA pathways.\" For more information on SINTX Technologies or its materials platform, visit www.sintx.com About EVONIK EVONIK Business High Performance Polymers, including its affiliate Evonik Operations GmbH, is one of the world leaders in specialty chemicals companies and active in over 100 countries.

(the \"Company\") approved a global productivity plan (the \"Plan\") designed to strengthen the company's market position, enhance efficiency and deliver greater value to consumers while advancing the Company's turnaround strategy. The Company plans to reduce its professional and clerical headcount by approximately 10% globally (approximately 900 employees) and to close approximately twenty Company-operated retail locations in connection with the Plan. Actions under the Plan will begin in the fourth quarter of 2025 and are expected to be substantially implemented by the end of 2026, with U.S.-based professional and clerical separations expected to be largely concluded by the end of 2025. Decisions regarding the elimination of positions as well as the timing of separations are subject to local law and consultation requirements in certain countries, as well as the Company's business needs. Once the changes under the Plan are fully executed, the Company expects to realize annualized pre-tax cost savings in the range of approximately $110 million to $130 million. The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $75 million to $90 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges in connection with the Plan, substantially all of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal 2026. These estimated charges consist primarily of $63million to $78 million in charges related to cash severance payments and other termination benefits, approximately $8 million in charges related to employee transition costs, and approximately $4 million of other charges, including those associated with legal and store closure costs. Of the aggregate amount of charges that the Company estimates it will incur in connection with the Plan, the Company expects that substantially all of the approximately $75 million to $90 million will be in cash expenditures. The estimates of the charges and expenditures that the Company expects to incur in connection with the Plan, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual amounts may differ materially from estimates.

Professional and clerical separations in the United States are largely expected to occur this month, with international actions continuing through 2026, subject to local law and consultation requirements. \"We've made meaningful progress executing our strategy and strengthening Newell Brands, but there is more work to do,\" said Chris Peterson, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"This productivity plan is about taking the next, disciplined step to enhance efficiency, sharpen our strategic focus, and deliver stronger, more consistent performance. Ultimately, our goal is to deliver greater value for consumers and create sustained long-term value for our shareholders.\" Building on the company's turnaround strategy launched in 2023, the productivity plan will raise performance standards, simplify processes, streamline overhead, and redirect resources to the highest-value activities. The plan is enabled in part by the company's use of automation, digitization, and artificial intelligence to simplify operations, accelerate decision-making, and strengthen execution across functions. These initiatives will enable Newell to further invest in innovation, brand building, and growth in a dynamic consumer environment. As part of this effort, Newell Brands will close approximately 20 Yankee Candle stores in the United States and Canada which, collectively, represent roughly 1% of brand sales, with closures expected to take effect in January 2026. This retail optimization aligns the brand's footprint with modern consumer shopping behaviors and supports its multi-channel growth strategy. The company expects to record pre-tax restructuring and related charges of approximately $75 million to $90 million, primarily for severance and related costs, with most of the charges to be recognized by the end of 2026. Once fully implemented, the productivity plan is expected to generate annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $110 million to $130 million. The company affirmed its previously issued guidance for fourth quarter normalized operating margin, normalized earnings per share and operating cash flow. The company now expects that fourth quarter net and core sales results will be towards the lower end of its previously communicated guidance range as sales trends in Latin America continue to improve, but at a rate slower than originally anticipated. Chris Peterson and Mark Erceg, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the productivity plan and its expected benefits at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer & Retail Conference on December 2, 2025. About Newell Brands Newell Brands (NASDAQ: NWL) is a leading global consumer goods company with a strong portfolio of well-known brands, including Rubbermaid, Sharpie, Graco, Coleman, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Yankee Candle, Paper Mate, FoodSaver, Dymo, EXPO, Elmer's, Oster, NUK, Spontex and Campingaz. Newell Brands is focused on delighting consumers by lighting up everyday moments. This press release and additional information about Newell Brands are available on the company's website, www.newellbrands.com News Release Non-GAAP Financial Measures This release and the accompanying remarks contain non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that are included in this press release both to explain its results to stockholders and the investment community and in the internal evaluation and management of its businesses. The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures and the information they provide are useful to investors since these measures (a) permit investors to view the Company's performance and liquidity using the same tools that management uses to evaluate the Company's past performance, reportable segments, prospects for future performance and liquidity, and (b) determine certain elements of management incentive compensation. The Company's management believes that core sales provides a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales on a consistent basis as it excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, retail store openings and closings, certain market and category exits, changes in foreign exchange and customer returns due to a product recall from year-over-year comparisons. The effect of changes in foreign exchange on reported sales is calculated by applying the prior year average monthly exchange rates to the current year local currency sales amounts (excluding acquisitions and divestitures), with the difference between the current year reported sales and constant currency sales presented as the foreign exchange impact increase or decrease in core sales. The Company's management believes that \"normalized\" operating margin and \"normalized\" earnings per share, which exclude restructuring and restructuring-related expenses; impairment charges; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; divestiture costs; costs related to the acquisition, integration and financing of acquired businesses; inflationary adjustments and one-time and other events such as expenses related to certain legal proceedings, costs related to the extinguishment of debt; certain tax benefits and charges; pension settlement charges; costs related to a product recall; certain facility fire related costs; and certain other items, are useful because they provide investors with a meaningful perspective on the current underlying performance of the Company's core ongoing operations. The Company uses a \"with\" and \"without\" approach to calculate normalized income tax expense or benefit. At an interim period, the Company determines the year to date tax effect of the pretax items excluded from normalized results by allocating the difference between the calculated GAAP and calculated normalized tax expense or benefit. While the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's performance and liquidity, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from similar measures presented by other companies.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981921315193176}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.99811851978302}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9937527775764465}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995507597923279}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.7360957264900208}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9976981282234192}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981141090393066}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.998251736164093}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9959596991539001}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9982799291610718}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9981561303138733}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981157779693604}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.6708748936653137}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9980273842811584}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.874801754951477}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9987585544586182}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994764924049377}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9958691000938416}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9970831274986267}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996129870414734}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996312856674194}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995908141136169}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992539286613464}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995629191398621}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999567449092865}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995006322860718}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996117949485779}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996389150619507}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996113181114197}], "sentiment": "positive"}], "overall_sentiment": "positive", "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": null}, "000143774925036507": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1285819/000143774925036507/omer20251024_8k.htm", "filing_date": "Mon, 1 Dec 2025 08:30:21 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": true, "ticker": "OMER", "items": {"item 1.02": {"text": "Item 1.02.

At the closing of the Transaction (the \"Closing\"), Omeros received an upfront cash payment of $240.0 million, approximately $72.6 million of which was used to repay the Credit Agreement as described in Item 1.02 above. In addition, Omeros can receive (i) up to a total of $510 million in one-time milestone payments upon the first achievement by Novo Nordisk or its affiliates or sublicensees of each of the development and approval milestone events as set forth in the Agreement and (ii) up to $1.3 billion in one-time milestone payments upon the first achievement by Novo Nordisk or its affiliates or sublicensees of certain sales-based milestone events as set forth in the Agreement. The upfront cash received at closing and the potential milestone payments represent a total of $2.1 billion. Omeros is also eligible under the Agreement to receive tiered royalties on annual net sales of Products at percentage rates ranging from high single digit to high teens, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, as set forth in the Agreement. Novo Nordisk is strongly positioned to develop zaltenibart into a differentiated and potentially best-in-class treatment approach for a number of rare blood and kidney disorders, maximizing the opportunity to help people living with these diseases in the future and supporting the company's leadership ambition in this space. Omeros retains rights to its MASP-3 small-molecule program unrelated to zaltenibart, including the ability to develop and commercialize small-molecule MASP-3 inhibitors with limited restrictions on indications. Omeros also retains rights to its \"grandfathered\" MASP-3 antibodies, with temporal and indication restrictions on commercialization and for use in advancing its small-molecule therapeutics. In accordance with the Agreement, at the Closing, the Company and Novo Nordisk entered into a transition services agreement (the \"Transition Services Agreement\") pursuant to which the Company will provide certain transition services to Novo Nordisk to facilitate the transfer of the acquired assets and liabilities under the Agreement and to provide for the continued operation of relevant studies and program activities during the applicable term. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, Novo Nordisk will reimburse the Company for costs and expenses incurred by the Company under the Transition Services Agreement, including third-party costs and expenses and costs associated with delivery of transition services by Omeros personnel on an hourly basis at rates specified in the Agreement.

Zaltenibart is a first-in-class, late-stage clinical humanized monoclonal antibody targeting MASP-3 the most upstream and key activator of the alternative pathway of the complement system and has shown multiple potential advantages over other alternative pathway inhibitors in development or on the market. The transaction was completed pursuant to an asset purchase and license agreement that was announced on October 15, 2025 Omeros is eligible to receive upfront and near-term milestone payments up to $340.0 million, of which the upfront amount of $240.0 million was paid in cash at closing. In total, Omeros is eligible to receive up to $2.1 billion including potential development and commercial milestones, plus tiered royalties on net sales. Novo Nordisk is strongly positioned to develop zaltenibart into a differentiated and potentially best-in-class treatment approach for a number of rare blood and kidney disorders, maximizing the opportunity to help people living with these diseases in the future and supporting the company's leadership ambition in this space. Omeros retains rights to its MASP-3 small-molecule program unrelated to zaltenibart, including the ability to develop and commercialize small-molecule MASP-3 inhibitors with limited restrictions on indications. At the closing, Omeros prepaid the entire $67.1 million principal amount outstanding under its senior secured term loan, along with a related pre-payment premium, accrued and unpaid interest, and expenses. The prepayment resulted in the termination of the senior secured credit agreement between Omeros and the term loan lenders and the release in full of all liens and covenants thereunder, including the $25.0 million minimum liquidity covenant. Omeros expects that the remaining proceeds from the closing payment will be sufficient to repay at or prior to maturity the remaining $17.1 million principal balance on its 2026 Convertible Notes and fund more than 12 months of operations, including the anticipated U.S. launch of narsoplimab for the treatment of transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA). About zaltenibart Zaltenibart (OMS906) is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-3 (MASP-3), the key and most upstream activator of the alternative pathway of the complement system and a critical component of innate immunity involved in host defense and immune regulation. By inhibiting MASP-3, zaltenibart is designed to address complement-mediated diseases driven by alternative pathway dysregulation. MASP-3 is responsible for converting complement pro-factor D to its active form, factor D. With low systemic levels compared to other alternative pathway proteins and slow clearance from circulation, MASP-3 is considered a highly attractive therapeutic target. Unlike inhibitors of C3 or C5, MASP-3 inhibition preserves classical pathway activity, which is critical to vaccine-induced immunity and defense against infections. Moreover, MASP-3 is not believed to be an acute-phase reactant, potentially offering another significant advantage for MASP-3 inhibitors like zaltenibart. Zaltenibart has potential applications across a broad range of therapeutic areas and indications, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), renal diseases such as immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), C3 glomerulopathy and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and other immune and complement-driven disorders. About Omeros Corporation Omeros is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing first-in-class small-molecule and protein therapeutics for both large-market and orphan diseases, with a particular emphasis on complement-mediated diseases, cancers, and addictive or compulsive disorders. Omeros' lead MASP-2 inhibitor narsoplimab targets the lectin pathway of complement and is under regulatory review by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy. OMS1029, a long-acting MASP-2 inhibitor, has successfully completed Phase 1 clinical trials. Pursuant to a recently announced agreement, Novo Nordisk acquired global rights to zaltenibart (formerly OMS906), a MASP-3 inhibitor in clinical development for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and other alternative pathway indications, including associated intellectual property and related assets. Omeros is entitled to receive cash milestone payments upon Novo Nordisk's achievement of certain development, approval, and sales-based milestones related to zaltenibart and certain related therapeutic antibodies, as well as royalties on net sales of commercialized products. Omeros' pipeline also includes OMS527, a phosphodiesterase 7 inhibitor in clinical development for cocaine use disorder, fully funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, as well as a growing portfolio of novel molecular and cellular therapeutic programs for oncology.

The Term Loan Repayment resulted in the termination of the Credit Agreement and release in full of all liens and covenants thereunder including the covenant requiring the Company to maintain at all times a minimum of $25.0 million of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Upon the occurrence of such events, the Credit Agreement was terminated. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2025 gives effect to the Transaction and Term Loan Repayment as if they had occurred on September 30, 2025. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2025 give effect to the Transaction and Term Loan Repayment as if they had occurred on January 1, 2024. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and the notes thereto contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 31, 2025, as amended, and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2025 contained in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on November 13, 2025. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are presented based on information currently available and are provided for informational purposes only. They are not intended to represent what the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and balance sheet actually would have been had the Transaction and Term Loan Repayment occurred on the applicable date indicated above, nor do they reflect all actions that may be undertaken by the Company following Closing. In addition, these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the Company's results of operations and financial position for any future period. The \"Historical Omeros (as reported)\" column in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements reflects the Company's historical condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods presented and does not reflect any adjustments related to the Transaction or the Term Loan Repayment. The \"Asset Sale and License Adjustments\" column in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements was based on available information and assumptions that reflects the impacts of events directly attributable to the Transaction which management believes are reasonable and factually supportable. Likewise, the \"Term Loan Repayment\" column in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements was based on available information and assumptions that reflects the impacts of events directly attributable to the Term Loan Repayment which management believes are reasonable and factually supportable.

The condensed consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements to give effect to both the disposition of the Company's clinical-stage complement-targeted therapeutic candidate, zaltenibart, and the Term Loan Repayment under the Credit Agreement. Adjustments to the Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Explanations of the adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are as follows: a. Net proceeds from the Transaction reflects gross consideration of $240.0 million after deducting estimated transaction fees of $2.3 million. b. Derecognition of the transaction costs which were captured through accounts payable and accrueds as of September 30, 2025, which are paid from gross proceeds of the Transaction. The Company currently does not anticipate any income tax expense as it has sufficient net operating losses and other tax attributes for which valuation allowances were previously established that can be utilized to cover the net gain on the sale. c. Repayment of principal outstanding under the Credit Agreement of $67.1 million, a prepayment premium of $3.4 million, incurred interest of $2.0 million and approximately $0.1 million of transaction related expenses as of the Closing. d. Unwinding of accrued interest on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2025 of $0.7 million which was paid at Closing. e. Comprised of the following: (1) repayment of principal outstanding under the Credit Agreement of $67.1 million, (2) derecognition of the unamortized premium of approximately $18.8 million related to marking-to-market the term debt to fair market value at the acquisition date, net of issuance costs and (3) derecognition of the associated embedded derivative liability of $1.6 million. f. Non-recurring estimated net gain on extinguishment of the term debt is comprised of eliminating the following: $18.8 million of unamortized debt premium and issuance costs and $1.6 million of the term debt embedded derivative liability reflected on our September 30, 2025 balance sheet, partially offset by a prepayment penalty expense of $3.4 million, additional interest expense incurred after September 30, 2025 of $1.3 million, which is net of what was accrued and previously expensed as of September 30, 2025, and transaction related expenses of approximately $0.1 million. g. Derecognition of OMS906 program costs which otherwise would not have been incurred if the Closing occurred on January 1, 2024. h. Non-recurring upfront proceeds from the sale of zaltenibart to Novo Nordisk of $240.0 million less estimated transaction costs of approximately $1.2 million, which is net of what was accrued and previously expensed as of September 30, 2025. i. To reflect the elimination of the term debt interest expense, including amortization of debt premium and capitalized debt issuance costs, which otherwise would not have been incurred if the Closing occurred on January 1, 2024. j. Derecognition of a $1.8 million loss on the fair value remeasurement of the term debt embedded derivative.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "positive", "score": 0.997556209564209}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9055652022361755}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9980334639549255}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9935277104377747}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9900240302085876}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.8528568744659424}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9981539845466614}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996212720870972}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996088147163391}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996528625488281}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996441602706909}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995710253715515}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996115565299988}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996095299720764}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995970129966736}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996304512023926}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995406866073608}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995020627975464}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9987460374832153}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9916585087776184}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995673298835754}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996185302734375}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.547096312046051}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993312358856201}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.994911253452301}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.998337984085083}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9944614171981812}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9944961667060852}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.981685221195221}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9972615242004395}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9353578090667725}], "sentiment": "neutral"}], "overall_sentiment": "positive", "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": null}, "000114036125043724": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49196/000114036125043724/ny20057909x3_8k.htm", "filing_date": "Mon, 1 Dec 2025 08:27:23 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": true, "ticker": "HBANP", "items": {"item 7.01": {"text": "Regulation FD Disclosure.

Authorized Capital . The aggregate number of shares of capital stock the Bank is authorized to issue is (i) five hundred million (500,000,000) shares of common stock, all one class having a par value of $2.50 per share (the \"Common Stock\"), and (ii) five hundred million (500,000,000) shares of preferred stock, having a par value of $0.01 per share (the \"Preferred Stock\"). Each share of the Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote on all matters requiring a vote of the shareholders. Subject to any preferences and rights of any holders of any other class of stock, holders of the Common Stock shall have the right to receive such dividends as may be declared from time to time by the Bank's Board of Directors and, upon any liquidation or dissolution of the Bank, shall be entitled to receive the net assets of the Bank. The Board of Directors is hereby expressly vested with the authority to approve the repurchase of any shares of Common Stock, determine the timing, manner or terms of any such repurchase or establish the methodology for determining any such timing, manner or terms, including by means of one or more share repurchase programs or plans, and determine whether any such repurchased shares shall be held by the Bank as treasury shares or shall be retired and the consequences thereof. Shares of the Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more classes or series by the Bank's Board of Directors. The Bank's Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized, subject to the limitations provided by law, to amend these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to establish and designate classes or series of the Preferred Stock, to fix the number of shares constituting each class or series, and to fix the designations and the voting powers, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of each class or series and the variations in the relative powers, rights, preferences and limitations as between or among classes or series, and to increase and to decrease the number of shares constituting each class or series.

A liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Bank, as such terms are used in this subparagraph (e), shall not be deemed to be occasioned by or to include any consolidation or merger of the Bank with or into any other entity or entities or a sale, lease or conveyance of all or a part of the assets of the Bank; (f) Whether or not the shares of such class or series shall have voting rights and the terms and conditions thereof; (g) Whether or not a sinking fund or purchase fund shall be provided for the redemption or purchase of the shares of such class or series, and if such a sinking fund or purchase fund shall be provided, the terms and conditions thereof; (h) Whether or not the shares of such class or series shall have conversion privileges, and, if such shares shall have conversion privileges, the terms and conditions of conversion, including but not limited to, any provision for the adjustment of the conversion rate or the conversion price; and (i) Any other powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Article 5 or the limitations provided by applicable law.

Shareholders . The names and places of residences of the stockholders and the number of shares held by each of them as required under Miss. Code Ann. Section 81-3-7(e) is available upon request to the Bank. Such information may be obtained by submitting a request to Cadence Bank, Corporate Secretary, 201 South Spring Street, Tupelo, MS 38804; CorporateSecretary@cadencebank.com ; or 662-680-2000. Board of Directors . The Board of Directors of the Bank shall consist of such number of members not less than nine (9) nor more than twenty (20), the exact number to be fixed and determined from time to time by resolution of a majority of the entire Board of Directors. The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III, until the Bank's annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2027. Class I directors shall be those elected at the annual meeting of shareholders held in 2024 for a three-year term, and they and any successors shall stand for re-election at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2027; each Class II director shall serve out his or her current three-year term, and each and any successors shall stand for re-election for a one-year term beginning at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2026; each Class III director shall be elected at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2025 for a one-year term, and they and any successors shall stand for re-election at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2026. At each annual meeting of shareholders commencing with the annual meeting of shareholders to be held in 2027, each director shall be elected for a one-year term, and, from that point forward, each director shall have a one-year term and shall hold office until his or her term expires at the next annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified, subject to his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. So long as the Board of Directors is classified, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes in such a manner as the Board of Directors shall determine so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible. If a vacancy occurs on the Board of Directors for any reason, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors, the Board of Directors may fill the vacancy, provided that the Board of Directors may elect instead to (i) not fill the vacancy or (ii) have the vacancy filled by vote of the shareholders at any regular or special meeting of the shareholders. Shareholders shall have no right to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. Removal of Directors . A director of the Bank may be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors of the Bank or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders. Shareholders also may remove a director of the Bank without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than sixty-seven (67%) of the outstanding voting stock of the Bank. For the purposes of this provision, \"cause\" means final conviction of a felony, unsound mind, conduct prejudicial to the interests of the Bank, or suspension and/or temporary prohibition from participating in the affairs of the Bank by a notice served under section 8(e)(3) or (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(3) and (g)(1)) or other similar law or regulation. Elimination of Certain Liability of Directors . A director of the Bank shall not be held personally liable to the Bank or its successor, or the shareholders thereof, for monetary damages unless the director or officer acted in a grossly negligent manner or engaged in conduct which demonstrates a greater disregard of the duty of care than gross negligence, such as intentional tortious conduct or intentional breach of his or her duty of loyalty or intentional commission of corporate waste. For the purposes of this provision, the term \"gross negligence\" means a reckless disregard of, or a carelessness amounting to gross indifference to, the best interests of the Bank or the shareholders thereof, and involves a substantial deviation below the standard of care expected to be maintained by a reasonably careful person under like circumstances. A director of the Bank shall, in the performance of his or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith on the records of the Bank and in relying in good faith upon information, opinions, reports or statements presented to him or her, to the Bank, to the Board of Directors or to any committee thereof by any of the Bank's officers or employees or by any committee of the Board of Directors, or by any counsel, appraiser, engineer or independent or certified public accountant selected with reasonable care by the Board of Directors or any committee thereof or by any officer having the authority to make such selection or by any other person as to matters the director in good faith believes are within such selected person's professional or expert competence, such person having been selected in good faith by the Board of Directors or any committee thereof or any officer having the authority to make such selection. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to eliminate any liability the elimination of which is contrary to the requirements of applicable state and federal banking laws and regulations. If the Code is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Bank shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Code, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of the provisions of this Article 9 by the shareholders shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Bank existing at the time of such repeal or modification. Indemnification . (a) The Bank shall indemnify, and upon request shall advance expenses prior to final disposition of a proceeding to, any person (or the estate or personal representative of any person) who was or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether or not by or in the right of the Bank, and whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Bank, or is or was serving at the request of the Bank as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability incurred in the action, suit or proceeding: (a) to the full extent permitted by Section 79-4-8.51 of the Code; and (b) despite the fact that such person has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 79-48.51(a) of the Code or would be disqualified for indemnification under Section 79-4-8.51(d) of the Code, if a determination is made by a person or persons enumerated in Section 79-4-8.55(b) of the Code that (i) the director, officer, employee or agent is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all of the relevant circumstances, and (ii) the acts or omissions of the director, officer, employee or agent did not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. A request for reimbursement or advancement of expenses prior to final disposition of the proceeding need not be accompanied by the affirmation required by Section 79-4-8.53(a)(1) of the Code, but the remaining provisions of Section 79-4-8.53 of the Code shall be applicable to any such request. The Bank may, to the full extent permitted by law, purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any such person against any liability which may be asserted against him or her. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to allow for indemnification for liability resulting from a violation that is prohibited from being indemnified by any provision of Title 81, nor shall any part of this section be construed to allow for indemnification in contravention of Section 81-5-2 of the Code or Part 359 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations (12 C.F.R. Part 359). (b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in Subsection (a) of this Article 10 are intended to be greater than those which are otherwise provided for in the Code, are contractual between the Bank and the person being indemnified, and the heirs, executors and administrators of such person, and in this respect are mandatory, notwithstanding a person's failure to meet the standard of conduct required for permissive indemnification under the Code, as amended from time to time. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in Subsection (a) of this Article 10 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancements of expenses may be entitled or granted by law, these Articles of Incorporation, the bylaws, a resolution of the Board of Directors, a vote of the shareholders of the Bank, or an agreement with the Bank, which means of indemnification and advancement of expenses are hereby specifically authorized. Any repeal or modification of the provisions of this Article 10 shall not affect any obligations of the Bank or any rights regarding indemnification and advancement of expenses of a director, officer, employee or agent with respect to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification or the advancement of expenses is requested, in which the alleged cause of action accrued at any time prior to such repeal or modification. If an amendment to the Code hereafter limits or restricts in any way the indemnification rights permitted by law as of the date hereof, such amendment shall apply only to the extent mandated by law and only to activities of persons subject to indemnification under this Article 10 which occur subsequent to the effective date of such amendment. (c) If this Article 10 or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Bank shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee or agent of the Bank as to any liability incurred or other amounts paid with respect to any proceeding, including, without limitation, a grand jury proceeding and any proceeding by or in the right of the Bank, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article 10 that shall not have been invalidated, by the Code, or by any other applicable law. Unless the context otherwise requires, terms used in this Article 10 shall have the meanings given in Section 79-4-8.50 of the Code. Special Meetings of Shareholders . Special meetings of the shareholders, unless otherwise required by law, may be called at any time by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Secretary and shall be called by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors or of shareholders owning not less than twenty percent (20%) of all the shares of capital stock of the Bank issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at such meeting. Such written request must state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and the person or persons calling the meeting. Action Without Meeting of Shareholders . As permitted by the Code, action required or permitted to be taken at a shareholders' meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by at least the same majority of shareholders as would be required to take such action at a meeting of the shareholders where all the shareholders entitled to vote on such action were present, and delivered to the Bank for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. Venue . Unless the Bank consents in writing to the selection of an alternative venue, Lee County, Mississippi, shall be the sole and exclusive venue for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Bank, (b) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of the Bank to the Bank or the Bank's shareholders, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Chapter 4 of Title 79 of the Code, Title 81 of the Code, these Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Bank or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to a court of competent jurisdiction in Lee County, Mississippi having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Series A Preferred Stock Designation . The designation of the series of the Preferred Stock shall be \"5.50% Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock\" (the \"Series A Preferred Stock\"). With respect to payment of dividends and rights upon the Bank's liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Series A Preferred Stock shall rank (i) senior to the Common Stock, and any other class or series of the Preferred Stock that, by its terms, ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) equally with all existing and future class or series of the Preferred Stock that does not by its terms rank junior or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock, and (iii) junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Bank and any class or series of the Preferred Stock that expressly provides in the articles of amendment creating such class or series of the Preferred Stock that it ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock (subject to any requisite consents prior to issuance). Number of Shares . The number of authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be 6,900,000, which number may, from time to time, be increased (but not in excess of the total number of authorized shares of the Preferred Stock) or decreased (but not below the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding) by further resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof). The Bank may, from time to time, and without notice to, consent of or additional action by holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, issue additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock, provided that if the additional shares are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the initial shares of such series, the additional shares shall be issued under a separate CUSIP number. The additional shares would form a single series together with all previously issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Definitions . As used in this Article 14 with respect to Series A Preferred Stock: \"Business Day\" shall mean any weekday in New York, New York that is not a day on which banking institutions in such city are authorized or required by applicable law, regulation, or executive order to be closed. \"Dividend Payment Dates\" shall have the meaning set forth in Section (d)(ii) of this Article 14. \"Dividend Period\" shall mean the period from, and including, each Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date except for the initial Dividend Period which shall be the period from, and including, the original issue date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date. \"Junior Stock\" shall mean the Common Stock and any other class or series of the Bank's capital stock over which the Series A Preferred Stock has preference or priority in the payment of dividends and rights on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Bank. \"Liquidation Preference\" shall mean $25.00 per share of Series A Preferred Stock. \"Nonpayment\" shall have the meaning set forth in Section (g)(ii) of this Article 14. \"Optional Redemption\" shall have the meaning set forth in Section (f)(i) of this Article 14. viii. \"Parity Stock\" shall mean any class or series of the Bank's capital stock that ranks on par with the Series A Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends and rights on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Bank. \"Preferred Stock Directors\" shall have the meaning set forth in Section (g)(ii) of this Article 14. \"Redemption Price\" shall have the meaning set forth in Section (f)(iii) of this Article 14. \"Regulatory Capital Treatment Event\" shall mean a good faith determination by the Board of Directors that, as a result of any (a) amendment to, clarification of, or change (including any announced prospective change) in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock; (b) proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock; or (c) official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Bank shall not be entitled to treat the full liquidation value of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding as \"Tier 1 Capital\" (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy laws or regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Bank (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy laws or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding. \"Regulatory Event Redemption\" shall have the meaning set forth in Section (f)(ii) of this Article 14. xiii. \"Series A Preferred Stock\" shall have the meaning set forth in Section (a) of this Article 14. \"Voting Parity Stock\" shall have the meaning set forth in Section (g)(ii) of this Article 14. Dividends Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, only when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof), out of assets legally available under applicable law for payment, non-cumulative cash dividends based upon the Liquidation Preference, and no more, at a rate equal to 5.50% per annum, for each quarterly Dividend Period occurring from, and including, the original issue date of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock. When, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof), the Bank shall pay cash dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock quarterly, in arrears, on February 20, May 20, August 20 and November 20 of each year (each such date, a \"Dividend Payment Date\"), beginning on February 20, 2020, and, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof). The Bank shall pay cash dividends to the holders of record of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock as such holders appear on the Bank's stock register on the applicable record date, which shall be the fifteenth (15th) calendar day before that Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) that is not more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) calendar days prior to such Dividend Payment Date. If any Dividend Payment Date is a day that is not a Business Day, then the dividend with respect to that Dividend Payment Date shall instead be paid on the immediately succeeding Business Day, without interest or other payment in respect of such delayed payment. The Bank shall calculate dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. Dollar amounts resulting from such calculation shall be rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded upward. Dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be cumulative or mandatory. If the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or if the Board of Directors authorizes and the Bank declares less than a full dividend in respect of any Dividend Period, the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have no right to receive any dividend or a full dividend, as the case may be, for the Dividend Period, and the Bank shall have no obligation to pay a dividend or to pay full dividends for that Dividend Period at any time, whether or not dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or any other series of the Preferred Stock or Common Stock are declared for any future Dividend Period. Dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall accrue from the original issue date of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the dividend rate on the liquidation preference amount of $25.00 per share. If the Bank issues additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, dividends on those additional shares shall accrue from the original issue date of those additional shares at the dividend rate. So long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding: (1) no dividend shall be declared and paid or set aside for payment and no distribution shall be declared and made or set aside for payment on any Junior Stock (other than a dividend payable solely in shares of Junior Stock or any dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholder rights plan or the redemption or repurchase of any rights under such a plan, including with respect to any successor shareholder rights plan); (2) no shares of Junior Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed, or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Bank, directly or indirectly (other than as a result of a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock, or the exchange for or conversion into Junior Stock, through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Junior Stock or pursuant to a contractually binding requirement to buy Junior Stock pursuant to a binding stock repurchase plan existing prior to the most recently completed Dividend Period), nor shall any monies be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such securities by the Bank; and (3) no shares of Parity Stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Bank (other than pursuant to pro rata offers to purchase all, or a pro rata portion, of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock, through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock, as a result of a reclassification of Parity Stock for or into other Parity Stock, or by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock), during a Dividend Period, unless, in each case of subsections (a), (b) and (c) immediately above, the full dividends for the most recently completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside. The foregoing limitations in subsections (a), (b) and (c) immediately above shall not apply to purchases or acquisitions of the Bank's Junior Stock pursuant to any employee or director incentive or benefit plan or arrangement (including any of the Bank's employment, severance, or consulting agreements) of the Bank or of any of the Bank's subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter adopted. viii. Except as provided below, for so long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, the Bank shall not declare, pay, or set aside for payment full dividends on any Parity Stock unless the Bank has paid in full, or set aside payment in full, in respect of all unpaid dividends for all Dividend Periods for outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. To the extent that the Bank declares dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and on shares of any Parity Stock but cannot make full payment of such declared dividends, the Bank shall allocate the dividend payments on a pro rata basis among the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of any Parity Stock then outstanding. For purposes of calculating the pro rata allocation of partial dividend payments, the Bank shall allocate dividend payments based on the ratio between the then current and the unpaid dividend payments due on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and (1) in the case of cumulative Parity Stock, the aggregate of the accrued and unpaid dividends due on any such Parity Stock and (2) in the case of noncumulative Parity Stock, the aggregate of the declared but unpaid dividends due on any such Parity Stock. No interest shall be payable in respect of any dividend payment on shares of Series A Preferred Stock that may be in arrears. Subject to the foregoing conditions, and not otherwise, dividends (payable in cash, stock, or otherwise), as may be determined by the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof), may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any Junior Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in such dividends. Liquidation Rights In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Bank, the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the Bank's assets legally available for distribution to the Bank's shareholders, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of Common Stock or any other Junior Stock, a liquidating distribution in the amount equal to the sum of (1) the Liquidation Preference, plus (2) the sum of any declared and unpaid dividends for prior Dividend Periods prior to the Dividend Period in which the liquidation distribution is made and any declared and unpaid dividends for the then current Dividend Period in which the liquidation distribution is made to the date of such liquidation distribution. After payment of the full amount of the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled pursuant to the foregoing, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no right or claim to any remaining assets of the Bank. In the event that, upon any such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the available assets of the Bank are insufficient to pay the amount of the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of Parity Stock in the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Bank, then the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and such Parity Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they respectively would be entitled. For the purposes of this Section (e), the merger or consolidation of the Bank with or into any other entity or by another entity with or into the Bank or the sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Bank (for cash, securities or other consideration) shall not be deemed to constitute the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Bank. If the Bank enters into any merger or consolidation transaction with or into any other entity and the Bank is not the surviving entity in such transaction, shares of the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of the surviving or successor corporation or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving or successor corporation having terms identical to the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock set forth herein. Redemption Rights The Series A Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section (f), the Bank may redeem shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at its option, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after November 20, 2024, with not less than thirty (30) calendar days' and not more than sixty (60) calendar days' notice (an \"Optional Redemption\"), subject to the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, at the Redemption Price. Dividends shall not accrue on those shares of Series A Preferred Stock so redeemed on and after the applicable redemption date. In addition, the Bank may redeem shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in whole but not in part, at its option, for cash, at any time within ninety (90) calendar days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, subject to the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, at the Redemption Price (a \"Regulatory Event Redemption\"). The redemption price for any redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, whether an Optional Redemption or Regulatory Event Redemption, shall be equal to (A) $25.00 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, plus (B) any declared and unpaid dividends (without regard to any undeclared dividends) prior to, but excluding, the date of redemption (the \"Redemption Price\"). Any notice given as provided in this Section (f) shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives the notice, and any defect in the notice or in the provision of the notice, to any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock designated for redemption will not affect the redemption of any other shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Any notice provided to a holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed given on the date provided, whether or not the holder actually receives the notice. A notice of redemption shall be given not less than thirty (30) calendar days and not more than sixty (60) calendar prior to the date of redemption specified in the notice, and shall specify (1) the redemption date, (2) the Redemption Price, (3) if fewer than all shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and (4) the manner in which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption may obtain payment of the Redemption Price in respect of those shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section (f), if the Series A Preferred Stock is issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock has been given by the Bank and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by the Bank in trust for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, then from and after the redemption date such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding for any purpose, all dividends with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall cease to accrue from the redemption date and all rights of the holders of such shares shall terminate, except the right to receive the Redemption Price, without interest. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to this Section (f) or purchased or otherwise acquired for value by the Bank shall, after such acquisition, have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the Preferred Stock and may be reissued by the Bank at any time as shares of any series of the Preferred Stock other than as Series A Preferred Stock. In the event that fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected either pro rata or by lot or in such other manner as the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines to be fair and equitable and permitted by the rules of any stock exchange on which the Series A Preferred Stock is listed, subject to the provisions hereof. The Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) shall have the full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed from time to time. No holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right to require the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock. Voting Rights Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights, except as set forth below or as otherwise required by the Code. Whenever dividends payable on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or any other class or series of the Preferred Stock ranking equally with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which voting rights equivalent to those described in this paragraph have been conferred and are exercisable, have not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount equal to, as to any class or series, the equivalent of at least six (6) or more quarterly Dividend Periods, whether or not for consecutive Dividend Periods (a \"Nonpayment\"), the holders of outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock voting as a class with holders of shares of any other series of the Preferred Stock ranking equally with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (\"Voting Parity Stock\"), shall be entitled to vote for the election of two (2) additional directors of the Board of Directors on the terms set forth in this Section (g) (and to fill any vacancies in the terms of such directorships) (the \"Preferred Stock Directors\"). Holders of shares of all series of Voting Parity Stock shall vote as a single class. In the event that the holders of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote as described in this Section (g), the number of members of the Board of Directors at that time shall be increased by two (2) directors, and the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right, as members of that class, to elect two (2) directors at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least twenty percent (20%) of the aggregate voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock or any other series of Voting Parity Stock (unless such request is received less than ninety (90) calendar days before the date fixed for the Bank's next annual or special meeting of the shareholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of the shareholders), provided that the election of any Preferred Stock Directors shall not cause the Bank to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the securities of the Bank may at such time be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors, and provided further that at no time shall the Board of Directors include more than two (2) Preferred Stock Directors. The Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the Bank's shareholders unless they have been previously terminated or removed pursuant to Section (g)(iv). In case any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director occurs (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors), the vacancy may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or, if none remains in office, by the vote of the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock (together with holders of any shares of Voting Parity Stock) to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders. When the Bank has paid full dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for the equivalent of at least four (4) Dividend Periods, following a Nonpayment, then the right of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to elect the Preferred Stock Directors set forth in this Section (g) shall cease (subject to the continued applicability of the provisions for the vesting of the special voting rights in the case of any future Nonpayment). Upon termination of the right of the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock to vote for Preferred Stock Directors as set forth in this Section (g), the term of office of all Preferred Stock Directors then in office elected by only those holders shall terminate immediately. Whenever the term of office of the Preferred Stock Directors ends and the related voting rights have expired, the number of directors automatically will be decreased to the number of directors as otherwise would prevail. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock (together with holders of any shares of Voting Parity Stock) when they have the voting rights described in Section (g)(ii). So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Bank shall not, without the affirmative vote or consent of holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any Voting Parity Stock, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or at any meeting called for the purpose, authorize, create or issue any shares of capital stock ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or reclassify any authorized capital stock into any such shares of such capital stock or issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase any such shares of capital stock. Further, so long as any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Bank shall not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock, amend, alter or repeal any provision of these Articles of the Bank, including by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to affect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any increase in the amount of authorized shares of Common Stock or authorized shares of the Preferred Stock, or any increase or decrease in the number of shares of any series of the Preferred Stock, or the authorization, creation and issuance of other classes or series of capital stock, in each case ranking on parity with or junior to the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, shall not be deemed to affect such powers, preferences or special rights, (b) a merger or consolidation of the Bank with or into another entity in which the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock (1) remain outstanding or (2) are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity or any entity, directly or indirectly, controlling such surviving entity and such new preference securities have powers, preferences and special rights that are not materially less favorable than the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to affect the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock and (c) the foregoing voting rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which the vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the Bank for the benefit of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to effect the redemption. Notice for a special meeting to elect the Preferred Stock Directors shall be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Bylaws for a special meeting of the shareholders. If the secretary of the Bank does not call a special meeting within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of any such request, then any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock may (at the Bank's reasonable expense) call such meeting, upon notice as provided in this Section (g)(vi) and, for that purpose, shall have access to the stock register of the Bank. Except as otherwise set forth in Section (g)(vi) hereof, the rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules that the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof), in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Articles, the Bylaws, and applicable laws and the rules of any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which Series A Preferred Stock is listed or traded at the time. viii. Each holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have one (1) vote per share on any matter on which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote. Conversion Rights . The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any rights to convert such shares into shares of any other class or series of stock or into any other securities of, or any interest or property in, the Bank. No Sinking Fund . No sinking fund shall be established for the retirement or redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. No Preemptive or Subscription Rights holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall, as such holder, have any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe for any additional shares of capital stock of the Bank or any other security of the Bank that it may issue or sell. Information Rights During any period in which the Bank is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Bank will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) transmit by mail (or other permissible means under the Exchange Act) to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock, as their names and addresses appear on the Bank's record books and without cost to such holders, copies of the annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q that the Bank would have been required to file with the FDIC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if the Bank were subject thereto (other than any exhibits that would have been required) and (ii) promptly, after receipt of written request, supply copies of such reports to any holders or prospective holder of Series A Preferred Stock. The Bank will use its reasonable best efforts to mail (or otherwise provide) the information to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock within 15 days after the respective dates by which a periodic report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, as the case may be, in respect of such information would have been required to be filed with the SEC, if the Bank were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, in each case, based on the dates on which it would be required to file such periodic reports if the Bank were a \"non-accelerated filer\" within the meaning of the Exchange Act. Certificates . Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be eligible for the Direct Registration System service offered by the Depository Trust Company and may be represented in the form of uncertificated or certificated shares. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be eligible for the Direct Registration System service offered by the Depository Trust Company and may be represented in the form of uncertificated or certificated shares; provided, however, that each holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled, upon request, to have a certificate for shares of Series A Preferred Stock reflecting the number of shares owned by such holder in such form as is provided under the Code and the Bylaws. Listing . The Bank agrees that for the period of time during which the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Bank will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) effect within thirty (30) days of issuance and delivery of the Series A Preferred Stock the listing of the Series A Preferred Stock on the New York Stock Exchange and (ii) maintain the listing of the Series A Preferred Stock on the New York Stock Exchange or another national securities exchange. No Other Rights . The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not have any designations, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights except as set forth in these Articles or as otherwise required by applicable law, including the Code.

Section 2.2 ANNUAL MEETING. An annual meeting of the shareholders of the Bank shall be held during the third, fourth or fifth month following the end of the Bank's fiscal year on such date as may be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors. The business to be transacted at such meeting shall be the election of directors and such other business as shall be properly brought before the meeting. If the election of directors is not held on the date determined by the Board of Directors for an annual meeting, or at any adjournment of such meeting, the Board of Directors shall call a special meeting of the shareholders as soon as conveniently possible thereafter.

Such written request must state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and the person or persons calling the meeting. Section 2.4 NOTICE OF MEETING (a) Written notice stating the (i) place or providing instructions on how to access the meeting by electronic transmission or other means of remote communication, (ii) date, and (iii) time of the annual meeting of shareholders of the Bank and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall, unless otherwise prescribed by statute, be delivered not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the shareholder at the shareholder's address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the Bank with postage paid thereon. (b) Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to shareholders, any notice to shareholders given by the Bank under any provision of Chapter 5 of Title 81 of the Mississippi Code (the \"Banking Act\"), the Mississippi Business Corporation Act (the \"Act\"), the Bank's Articles of Incorporation (the \"Articles\") or these Bylaws, shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the shareholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the shareholder by written notice to the Bank. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the Bank is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Bank in accordance with such consent, and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary of the Bank or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) shall be deemed delivered: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the shareholder has consented to receive notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the shareholder has consented to receive notice; (3) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the shareholder of such specific posting when such notice is directed to the record address of the shareholder or to such other address at which the shareholder has consented to receive notice, upon the later of such posting or the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when consented to by the shareholder. In addition, notice can be given in any manner authorized by the Act. Section 2.5 VOTING LIST. The officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the Bank shall make a complete list of the shareholders entitled to notice of a meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, arranged by voting group (and within each voting group by class or series of shares), and in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each shareholder. The list shall be available for inspection beginning two (2) business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the principal office of the Bank, and shall be subject to inspection on written demand by any shareholder or the shareholder's agent at any time during regular business hours. Such list shall also be available at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder or the shareholder's agent during the meeting or any adjournment. The original stock transfer books shall be prima facie evidence as to shareholders entitled to examine such list or transfer book or to vote at any meeting of shareholders. Section 2.6 QUORUM. A majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at the annual meeting of shareholders. A majority of the shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a special meeting of shareholders. If a quorum is present at any meeting of shareholders, action on a matter (other than the election of directors) is approved if the votes cast favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the vote of a greater number is required by the Articles, the Banking Act or the Act for any specific purpose. If a quorum is not established because a sufficient number of shares entitled to vote are not represented at the meeting in person or by proxy, the meeting may be adjourned by the presiding officer of the meeting without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. The shareholders present at a duly called meeting may continue to transact business for that meeting and for any adjournment thereof, unless a new record date must be set for that adjourned meeting, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. Section 2.7 PROXIES. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote his or her shares either in person or by proxy. A shareholder or the shareholder's agent may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appointment form, by electronic transmission or by any other method or means permitted under the laws of the State of Mississippi. An electronic transmission must contain or be accompanied by information from which the Bank can determine that the shareholder or the shareholder's agent authorized the electronic transmission. No proxy shall be valid after eleven (11) months from the date of execution, unless otherwise expressly provided in the appointment form, electronic transmission or other applicable method or means of appointment. Section 2.8 VOTING OF SHARES. Each outstanding share of the Bank's common stock entitled to vote shall be entitled to one (1) vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of the shareholders.

Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine. Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, or conservator may be voted by such person, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his or her name if the authority to do so is contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such administrator, executor, guardian, or conservator was appointed. Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his or her name if the authority to do so is contained in an appropriate order of the court by which such receiver was appointed. A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred. Shares of its own stock owned by the Bank or by any other corporation, the majority of whose voting shares are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Bank, shall not be voted at any meeting, and shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time, except for any shares of the Bank which are held in a fiduciary capacity.

The number of nominees a shareholder may nominate for election at an annual meeting (or in the case of a shareholder giving notice on behalf of a beneficial owner, the number of nominees a shareholder may nominate for election at the meeting on behalf of such beneficial owner) shall not exceed the number of directors to be elected at such annual meeting. A shareholder's notice to the Secretary to submit a nomination or other business to an annual meeting of shareholders shall set forth: (i) the name and address of the shareholder, as they appear on the books and records of the Bank, and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made;

ARTICLE III RECORD DATE For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders, or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other purpose, the Board of Directors of the Bank may fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than seventy (70) days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination of shareholders is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders or to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders. When determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this Article III, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof unless the meeting is adjourned to a date more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date fixed for the original meeting, in which event the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date.

Thereafter, the Board shall promptly disclose its decision whether to accept the director's resignation offer (and the reasons for rejecting the resignation offer, if applicable) in a press release to be disseminated in the manner that press releases are typically distributed by the Bank. Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the Nominating Committee recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer. If each member of the Nominating Committee received a Majority Withheld Vote at the same election, then the independent directors who did not receive a Majority Withheld Vote shall appoint a committee amongst themselves to consider the resignation offers and recommend to the Board whether to accept them. However, if the only directors who did not receive a Majority Withheld Vote in the same election constitute three or fewer directors, all directors may participate in the action regarding whether to accept the resignation offers.

A vacancy that will occur at a later date, by reason of resignation or otherwise, may be filled before the vacancy occurs, but the new Director may not take office until the vacancy occurs. Section 4.6 COMPENSATION. No stated salary shall be paid to Directors for their services, except as prescribed by the Act or the Banking Act, but each Director shall receive compensation, as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors, for attendance at regular, special and committee meetings of the Board.

Such right to dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in favor of such action. Section 4.13 ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting, if all Directors consent to the taking of such action without a meeting by signing one or more written consents describing the action taken.

The Bank shall indemnify, and upon request shall advance expenses prior to final disposition of a proceeding to, any person (or the estate or personal representative of any person) who was or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether or not by or in the right of the Bank, and whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of the Bank, or is or was serving at the request of the Bank as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability incurred in the action, suit or proceeding: (a) to the full extent permitted by Section 79-4-8.51 of the Act, and (b) despite the fact that such person has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 79-4-8.51(a) of the Act or would be disqualified for indemnification under Section 79-4-8.51(d) of the Act, if a determination is made by a person or persons enumerated in Section 79-4-8.55(b) of the Act that (i) the director, officer, employee or agent is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all of the relevant circumstances, and (ii) the acts or omissions of the officer, employee or agent did not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. A request for reimbursement or advancement of expenses prior to final disposition of the proceeding need not be accompanied by the affirmation required by Section 79-4-8.53(a)(1) of the Act, but the remaining provisions of Section 79-4-8.53 of the Act shall be applicable to any such request. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to allow for indemnification for liability resulting from a violation that is prohibited from being indemnified by any provision of Title 81, nor shall any part of this section be construed to allow for indemnification in contravention of Section 81-5-2 of the Code or Part 359 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations (12 C.F.R.

The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in Section 7.1 of this Article VII are intended to be greater than those which are otherwise provided for in the Act, are contractual between the Bank and the person being indemnified, and the heirs, executors and administrators of such person, and in this respect are mandatory, notwithstanding a person's failure to meet the standard of conduct required for permissive indemnification under the Act, as amended from time to time. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled or granted by law, the Articles, these Bylaws, a resolution of the Board of Directors, vote of the shareholders of the Bank, or an agreement with the Bank, which means of indemnification and advancement of expenses are hereby specifically authorized. Any repeal or modification of the provisions of this Article VII shall not affect any obligations of the Bank or any rights regarding indemnification and advancement of expenses of a director, officer, employee or agent with respect to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification or the advancement of expenses is requested, in which the alleged cause of action accrued at any time prior to such repeal or modification. If an amendment to the Act hereafter limits or restricts in any way the indemnification rights permitted by law as of the date hereof, such amendment shall apply only to the extent mandated by law and only to activities of persons subject to indemnification under this Article VII which occur subsequent to the effective date of such amendment. Section 7.3 SEVERABILITY. If this Article VII or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Bank shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee or agent of the Bank as to any liability incurred or other amounts paid in with respect to any proceeding, including, without limitation, a grand jury proceeding and any proceeding by or in the right of the Bank, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VII that shall not have been invalidated, by the Act, or by any other applicable law.

SKNJCT-003, which commenced randomizing patients in August 2024, is a double blinded, placebo controlled triple arm proof of concept Phase 2 clinical study, designed to non-invasively treat basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin using novel, patent protected, dissolvable doxorubicin-containing microneedle arrays (D-MNA). In March 2025, the Company announced a positively trending interim analysis for SKNJCT-003 demonstrating more than 60% clinical clearance. The interim analysis was conducted after more than 50% of the then-targeted 60 patients in the study were randomized. The findings of the interim analysis are preliminary and may or may not correlate with the findings of the study once completed In September 2025, the Company received positive feedback from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its Type C meeting supporting the development of SkinJect, indicating that the Company may follow the FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to non-invasively treat BCC of the skin using dissolvable D-MNA. In October 2025, the Company treated its first patient in the clinical study (SKNJCT-004) currently underway in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The study is expected to randomize thirty-six (36) patients in six (6) sites in the UAE with Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi ( CCAD) as the principal investigator. Insights Research Organization and Solutions (IROS), a UAE-based contract research organization, is coordinating the clinical study for the Company. IROS is a M42 portfolio company. In November 2025, the company received full regulatory and ethical approvals in the United Kingdom to expand its ongoing Phase 2 clinical study (SKNJCT-003) evaluating D-MNA to non-invasively treat BCC of the skin. The approvals were issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the Health Research Authority (HRA) and the Wales Research Ethics Committee (WREC). The MHRA approval followed a comprehensive scientific review of the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD) and protocol. The WREC issued a favorable ethical opinion, and the HRA granted study wide governance approval, confirming compliance with U.K. Good Clinical Practice and National Health Service capacity and capability standards. Skinject Platform Expansion: In August 2025, the Company announced its entry into a non-binding memorandum of understanding (the \"MoU\") with Helix Nanotechnologies, Inc. (\"HelixNano\"), a Boston-based biotech company focused on developing a proprietary advanced mRNA platform, to explore co-development of thermostable infectious disease vaccines. Pipeline Expansion-Acquisition of Antev In August 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of Antev Limited (\"Antev\"), a UK-based late clinical stage biotech company, developing Teverelix, a next generation GnRH antagonist, as a first in market product for cardiovascular high-risk advanced prostate cancer patients and patients with first acute urinary retention relapse (AURr) episodes due to enlarged prostate. Antev's flagship drug candidate is Teverelix trifluoroacetate, a long-acting gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist. Unlike GnRH agonists, which can cause an initial surge in testosterone levels, Teverelix directly suppresses sex hormone production without this surge, potentially reducing cardiovascular risks. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for patients with existing cardiovascular conditions. Teverelix is formulated as a microcrystalline suspension, allowing for sustained release and a six-week dosing interval, which may improve patient compliance and outcomes. - 2 - Patient Access & Advocacy-Gorlin Syndrome Alliance Collaboration In October 2025, the Company announced a strategic collaboration with the Gorlin Syndrome Alliance (GSA) to advance compassionate access to SkinJectTM, the Company's investigational doxorubicin containing microneedle arrays (D-MNA) for patients suffering from Gorlin Syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Under the collaboration, Medicus and the GSA will jointly pursue the Expanded Access IND Program with the FDA to allow patients with multiple, recurrent, or inoperable BCCs of the skin to access SkinJectTM under physician-supervised treatment protocols. The initiative aims to establish a framework for expanded access while collecting valuable real-world safety and tolerability data to inform future regulatory filings. It will also more tightly integrate patient community-led insights and data into the design, monitoring, and long-term development of SkinJectTM in this rare disease population.

Medicus Pharma Ltd. (Nasdaq: MDCX) is a precision guided biotech/life sciences company focused on accelerating the clinical development programs of novel and potentially disruptive therapeutics assets. The Company is actively engaged in multiple countries, spread over three continents. SkinJect Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Medicus Pharma Ltd., is a development stage, life sciences company focused on commercializing novel, non-invasive treatment for basal cell skin cancer using a patented dissolvable microneedle patch to deliver a chemotherapeutic agent to eradicate tumors cells. The Company completed a phase 1 safety & tolerability study (SKNJCT-001) in March of 2021, which met its primary objective of safety and tolerability; the study also describes the efficacy of the investigational product D-MNA, with six (6) participants experiencing complete response on histological examination of the resected lesion. The Company is currently conducting a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical study (SKNJCT-003) in the United States and Europe. The Company has also commenced a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical study (SKNJCT-004) in the United Arab Emirates. In August 2025, the Company announced its entry into a non-binding memorandum of understanding (the \"MoU\") with Helix Nanotechnologies, Inc. (\"HelixNano\"), a Boston-based biotech company focused on developing a proprietary advanced mRNA platform, in respect of their shared mutual interest in the development or commercial arrangement contemplated by the MoU. The MoU is non-binding and shall not be construed to obligate either party to proceed with a joint venture or any further development or commercial arrangement, unless and until definitive agreements are executed. In August 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of Antev, a UK-based late clinical stage biotech company, developing Teverelix, a next generation GnRH antagonist, as a first in market product for cardiovascular high-risk advanced prostate cancer patients and patients with first acute urinary retention relapse (AURr) episodes due to enlarged prostate. Antev's flagship drug candidate is Teverelix trifluoroacetate, a long-acting gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist.

This mechanism is particularly beneficial for patients with existing cardiovascular conditions. Teverelix is formulated as a microcrystalline suspension, allowing for sustained release and a six-week dosing interval, which may improve patient compliance and outcomes - 3 - In September 2020, Antev completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in which Teverelix was shown to be well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities and demonstrated rapid testosterone suppression. The study included 48 healthy male volunteers. In February 2023, Antev also completed a Phase 2a study in fifty (50) patients with advanced prostate cancer (APC), where Teverelix achieved the primary endpoint of greater than 90% probability of castration levels of testosterone suppression (97.5%) but the secondary endpoint of maintaining this rate above 90% was not met with the probability dropping to 82.5% by Day 42. In January 2023, the FDA, reviewed the Phase 1 and Phase 2a data and provided written guidance on Antev's proposed Phase 3 trial design for Teverelix. This milestone supports the Company's clinical plans to develop Teverelix as a treatment for advanced prostate cancer patients with increased cardiovascular risk. In December 2023, FDA approved the Phase 2b study design in advanced prostate cancer covering 40 patients. In November 2024, FDA approved the Phase 2b study design in acute urinary retention covering 390 patients In October 2025, the Company announced a strategic collaboration with the Gorlin Syndrome Alliance (GSA) to advance compassionate access to SkinJectTM, the Company's investigational doxorubicin containing microneedle arrays (D-MNA) for patients suffering from Gorlin Syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.

(NYSE: SGI, \"Company\" or \"Somnigroup\") today announced that it submitted a proposal to the Board of Directors of Leggett & Platt Inc. (NYSE: LEG) to acquire all outstanding common shares of Leggett & Platt in an all-stock transaction (the \"Proposal\"). Under the terms of the Proposal, Leggett & Platt shareholders would receive shares of Somnigroup common stock with a market value of $12.00 for every one share of Leggett & Platt common stock, based on a fixed exchange ratio to be agreed. The Proposal offers Leggett & Platt shareholders a 30.3% premium to the average closing price of Leggett & Platt's shares during the last 30 trading days, representing a value not achieved by LEG shares since December 2024. The all-stock structure would enable Leggett & Platt shareholders to participate in the future growth potential of the combined company on a tax-deferred basis. \"Leggett & Platt has been an important supplier to our Company for many years,\" said Scott Thompson, Chairman and CEO of Somnigroup. \"This proposal would deliver significant value to Leggett & Platt shareholders through a compelling premium and tax-advantaged participation in our combined platform, while also being accretive before synergies to all Somnigroup shareholders.\" The Proposal was delivered to the Leggett & Platt Board in a letter on December 1, 2025. The full text of the letter is included below: December 1, 2025 Board of Directors Leggett & Platt Incorporated 1 Leggett Road Carthage, Missouri 64836 Attention: Mr. Karl G. Glassman, Board Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dear Karl and Members of the Board: I am writing to express our strong interest in pursuing a business combination transaction between Somnigroup International Inc. (\"Somnigroup\") and Leggett & Platt Incorporated (\"Leggett & Platt\"). We propose that Somnigroup acquire all of the outstanding shares of Leggett & Platt in an all-stock merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of Somnigroup, in which each outstanding share of Leggett & Platt common stock would be exchanged for shares of Somnigroup common stock having a market value of $12.00, based on a fixed exchange ratio to be agreed. Our proposed merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 17.0% to the closing price of Leggett & Platt shares on November 28, 2025, and a premium of approximately 30.3% over the average closing price of Leggett & Platt shares during the last 30 trading days a value that Leggett & Platt shareholders have not seen since December 2024. In addition, by receiving consideration comprised entirely of Somnigroup common stock, your shareholders will have the opportunity to participate fully on a tax-deferred basis in the significant growth potential and synergies of the combined company. We believe that a combination of Leggett & Platt with Somnigroup would be uniquely compelling for both companies and all of our collective stakeholders. Joining Leggett & Platt with a leading bedding manufacturer and bedding retailer would unquestionably foster significant strategic advantages and efficiencies for the combined company. Also, as you know, Somnigroup and Leggett & Platt have enjoyed an excellent commercial arrangement for many years. A significant mutual benefit of our proposal would be to ensure that this arrangement will continue without interruption. Leggett & Platt would continue to operate independently under the Somnigroup umbrella. Like Mattress Firm, Tempur Sealy and Dreams, Leggett & Platt's leadership team would enjoy significant autonomy. Leggett & Platt would also benefit from having a substantial and reliable customer in Tempur Sealy and greater opportunities for growth and success, all with a lower cost of capital and the strategic backing of Somnigroup. Additionally, because Leggett & Platt's business is complementary to Somnigroup's businesses, we would expect to not only retain most of Leggett & Platt's management team and employees, whose knowledge, experience and talent would be invaluable to the Somnigroup organization, but also provide them future career opportunities in the broader Somnigroup organization. We also expect to retain a significant presence in Carthage. We contemplate that our transaction would be subject only to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, which we expect would be obtained without difficulty or delay. Our transaction would not be subject to any financing contingency or require approval by Somnigroup's shareholders. Our proposal has been unanimously authorized by our Board of Directors. Based on our long history with Leggett & Platt, we would expect to be able to promptly complete confirmatory due diligence and execute definitive agreements. Our financial advisors are Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and our legal advisors are Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP. This proposal is subject to satisfactory completion of due diligence, the negotiation and execution of definitive transaction documents, and approval by the boards of directors of both companies. Unless and until such time, no obligation, commitment or undertaking of any kind shall arise as a result of this letter or any subsequent discussions. We believe this is a unique opportunity to deliver significant value to Leggett & Platt shareholders and better position a combined company to drive future shareholder value. We seek to work with you on a friendly basis to complete this transaction successfully and expeditiously. We hope that you share our enthusiasm and we would appreciate a response by December 22, 2025. Sincerely, Scott L. Thompson President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board Customary Approvals Completion of the contemplated transaction is contingent upon reaching a definitive agreement and would be subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of Leggett & Platt shareholder approval and required regulatory approvals. The proposed transaction would not be subject to any financing contingencies or approval by Somnigroup's shareholders.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "positive", "score": 0.997703492641449}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9988428354263306}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9977856874465942}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9944954514503479}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.994246780872345}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9982765913009644}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994531273841858}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9567672610282898}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9545024037361145}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9973695278167725}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9978354573249817}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9979962110519409}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981886744499207}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981222748756409}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9253545999526978}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994888305664062}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9416894316673279}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981439113616943}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9977395534515381}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9974297881126404}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9832838773727417}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9729094505310059}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981984496116638}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981073141098022}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993507266044617}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999277651309967}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994198083877563}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9983330368995667}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9972787499427795}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9949663281440735}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994553923606873}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9939024448394775}], "sentiment": "positive"}], "overall_sentiment": "positive", "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": null}, "000162828025054302": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1866175/000162828025054302/crgy-20251201.htm", "filing_date": "Mon, 1 Dec 2025 08:03:46 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": true, "ticker": "CRGY", "items": {"item 8.01": {"text": "Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations On December 1, 2025, Crescent Energy Company (the \"Company\") issued a press release announcing that its indirect subsidiary Crescent Energy Finance LLC (\"CE Finance\") has commenced (i) an offer to exchange (the \"2029 Notes Exchange Offer\") any and all 7.750% Senior Notes due 2029 (the \"Existing Vital 2029 Notes\") issued by Vital Energy, Inc.

(\"Vital\") that are held by Eligible Holders (as defined below) for up to $298,214,000 aggregate principal amount of new 7.75% Senior Notes due 2029 issued by CE Finance (the \"New Crescent 2029 Notes\") and (ii) an offer to exchange (the \"2030 Notes Exchange Offer\" and, together with the 2029 Notes Exchange Offer, the \"Exchange Offers\") any and all 9.750% Senior Notes due 2030 (the \"Existing Vital 2030 Notes\" and, together with the Existing Vital 2029 Notes, the \"Existing Vital Notes\") issued by Vital that are held by Eligible Holders for up to $302,364,000 aggregate principal amount of new 9.750% Senior Notes due 2030 issued by CE Finance (the \"New Crescent 2030 Notes\" and, together with the New Crescent 2029 Notes, the \"New Crescent Notes\"). In conjunction with the Exchange Offers, CE Finance is soliciting consents (each, a \"Consent\") from Eligible Holders to adopt certain proposed amendments (the \"Proposed Amendments\") to each of the indentures governing the Existing Vital Notes, which, if adopted, would eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants, certain events of default and certain other provisions currently contained therein (each, a \"Consent Solicitation\" and, collectively, the \"Consent Solicitations\"). The following table sets forth the Exchange Consideration and Total Exchange Consideration (each as defined in the Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement, as defined herein) for each series of Existing Vital Notes: Title of Series of Existing Vital Notes CUSIP/ISIN Number Issuer Aggregate Principal Amount Outstanding Exchange Consideration Total Exchange Consideration Consent Fee 7.75% Senior Notes due 2029 144A: 516806AH9 / US516806AH93 Reg S: U51319AE8/ USU51319AE89 Vital $298,214,000 $970 principal amount of new Crescent 7.75% Senior Notes due 2029 $1,000 principal amount of new Crescent 7.75% Senior Notes due 2029 $2.50 9.750% Senior Notes due 2030 516806AJ5 / US516806AJ59 Vital $302,364,000 $970 principal amount of new Crescent 9.750% Senior Notes due 2030 $1,000 principal amount of new Crescent 9.750% Senior Notes due 2030 $2.50 (1) For each $1,000 principal amount of the applicable Existing Vital Notes (as defined below) validly tendered after the Early Tender Date (as defined below) but at or before the Expiration Date (as defined below), not validly withdrawn and accepted for exchange. (2) For each $1,000 principal amount of the applicable Existing Vital Notes validly tendered at or before the Early Tender Date, not validly withdrawn and accepted for exchange. (3) If the Consent Threshold Condition (as defined in the Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement) is satisfied with respect to a series of Existing Vital Notes, each holder of such series as of the Settlement Date will receive $2.50 in cash for each $1,000 principal amount of such applicable Existing Vital Notes held by such holder on the Settlement Date, subject to the other conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement. An Eligible Holder may not tender their Existing Vital Notes in an Exchange Offer without delivering their Consents and may not deliver their Consents without tendering their Existing Vital Notes. Each Eligible Holder who validly tenders (and does not validly withdraw) their Existing Vital Notes pursuant to an Exchange Offer will be deemed to have validly delivered their Consent in the corresponding Consent Solicitation with respect to the principal amount of such tendered Existing Vital Notes. The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations are being made upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement, dated December 1, 2025 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the \"Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement\"). Each Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation is conditioned upon the Consent Threshold Condition, the Vital Acquisition Condition and the General Conditions (each as defined in the Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement), although CE Finance may waive any condition (other than the Vital Acquisition Condition) at any time with respect to an Exchange Offer and corresponding Consent Solicitation. Any waiver of a condition by CE Finance with respect to an Exchange Offer will automatically waive such condition with respect to the corresponding Consent Solicitation. The Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 30, 2025, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the \"Expiration Date\") or earlier terminated by CE Finance. Eligible Holders who validly tender their Existing Vital Notes on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 12, 2025, unless extended by CE Finance (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the \"Early Tender Date\"), will be eligible to receive, on the Settlement Date (as defined below), the applicable Total Exchange Consideration set forth in the table above for all such Existing Vital Notes that are accepted for exchange. Eligible Holders who validly tender their Existing Vital Notes after the Early Tender Date but on or prior to the Expiration Date will be eligible to receive, on the Settlement Date, the applicable Exchange Consideration set forth in the table above for all such Existing Vital Notes that are accepted for exchange. If the Consent Threshold Condition is satisfied with respect to a series of Existing Vital Notes, each holder of such series of Existing Vital Notes as of the Settlement Date will be paid $2.50 in cash for each $1,000 principal amount of Existing Vital Notes held by such holder as of the Settlement Date (the \"Consent Fee\"), subject to the other conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement. The Settlement Date will be a date that is promptly following the Expiration Date and is currently expected to be January 2, 2026, the second business day following the Expiration Date (the \"Settlement Date\").If the Vital Acquisition Condition has not been satisfied prior to the Expiration Date, CE Finance intends to extend the Expiration Date, without extending the Early Tender Date or the consent withdrawal deadline (unless required by law or unless CE Finance elects in its sole discretion to amend the Exchange Offers and the Consent Solicitations to allow further withdrawals) to have the Settlement Date substantially coincide with the consummation of Crescent's acquisition of Vital. The maturity date, interest rate and interest payment dates of each New Crescent Note issued pursuant to the Exchange Offers will be identical to, and the optional redemption provisions with respect to the subject New Crescent Note will be substantially the same as those applicable to, the corresponding Existing Vital Note for which such New Crescent Note was exchanged. No accrued and unpaid interest will be payable upon acceptance of any Existing Vital Notes in the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations (other than accrued and unpaid interest payable with respect to any fractional portion of New Crescent Notes not delivered in consideration of minimum denomination requirements). However, the first interest payment on the New Crescent Notes will include the accrued and unpaid interest from the applicable Existing Vital Notes tendered in exchange therefor so that a tendering Eligible Holder will receive the same interest payment they would have received had their Existing Vital Notes not been tendered in the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations. At any time at or before the Expiration Date, if CE Finance receives valid Consents from Eligible Holders sufficient to effect the Proposed Amendments with respect to the Existing Vital Notes of a subject series, Vital may execute and deliver on the date thereof or promptly thereafter a supplemental indenture containing the Proposed Amendments to the relevant Existing Vital Indenture, which will immediately become effective upon execution but will only become operative upon the exchange of all Existing Vital Notes of the subject series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the applicable Exchange Offer and the payment of the applicable Consent Fee with respect to such series to holders of Existing Vital Notes as of the Settlement Date, subject to the conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement. As a result, once the supplemental indenture effecting the Proposed Amendments with respect to the subject series of Existing Vital Notes is executed, any subsequent withdrawal of a tender of Existing Vital Notes of such series will not revoke the Consent previously delivered by operation of such tender. If the Proposed Amendments become operative with respect to a series of Existing Vital Notes, the Proposed Amendments will be binding on all holders of such series of Existing Vital Notes who did not validly tender their Existing Vital Notes in an Exchange Offer. However, even if such supplemental indenture is executed, if all Existing Vital Notes of the subject series validly tendered and not validly withdrawn are not exchanged by CE Finance pursuant to the applicable Exchange Offer and the Consent Fee with respect to such series is not paid to all holders of such series of Existing Vital Notes as of the Settlement Date, such supplemental indenture will be of no force and effect until the applicable exchange consideration and Consent Fee is paid. CE Finance, in its sole discretion, may modify or terminate any Exchange Offer and may extend the Early Tender Date (without extending the Withdrawal Deadline), the Expiration Date and/or the Settlement Date with respect to any Exchange Offer, subject to applicable law. Any such modification, termination or extension by CE Finance with respect to an Exchange Offer will automatically modify, terminate or extend the corresponding Consent Solicitation, as applicable. The Exchange Offers are only being made, and the New Crescent Notes are only being offered and will only be issued, and copies of the Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement and other related materials will only be made available, to holders of Existing Vital Notes who complete and return an eligibility form confirming, among other things, that they are either a \"qualified institutional buyer\" under Rule 144A or not a \"U.S. person\" and outside the United States under Regulation S for purposes of applicable securities laws (such a holder, an \"Eligible Holder\").

On November 26, 2025, Dar Bioscience, Inc. (\"we,\" \"us\", \"our,\" or the \"Company\") received notice from Bayer HealthCare LLC (\"Bayer\") that it was terminating the license agreement between the parties dated January 10, 2020 (the \"License Agreement\"). In accordance with the terms of the License Agreement, the termination will be effective 90 days from the date we received the notice, or February 24, 2026. Bayer's election to terminate the License Agreement was due to its strategic prioritization. The License Agreement related to the further development and commercialization of Ovaprene in the U.S. In connection with entering into the License Agreement, we received a $1.0 million upfront non-refundable license fee payment from Bayer, which will be recorded as license revenue upon termination of the License Agreement. Under the terms of the License Agreement, Bayer agreed to support us in development and regulatory activities by providing the equivalent of two experts to advise us in clinical, regulatory, preclinical, commercial, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and product supply matters, and we agreed to be responsible for the pivotal trial for Ovaprene and for its development and regulatory activities and product supply obligations. As a result of the termination of the License Agreement, we will not be receiving any future license fees or milestone or other payments from Bayer, and all licenses and rights we granted to Bayer will immediately terminate upon termination of the License Agreement. The foregoing summary of the License Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to a copy thereof, which was filed as Exhibit 10.8 to our annual report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on March 31, 2025, and is incorporated herein by reference. We do not expect the termination of the License Agreement to have a material impact on the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 multi-center, single arm, non-comparative clinical study of Ovaprene to evaluate its effectiveness as a contraceptive along with its safety and acceptability (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06127199). In July 2025, the study's data safety monitoring board (DSMB), an independent group of experts which evaluates the safety and integrity of the study, conducted a planned interim analysis and recommended the study continue without modification. In accordance with the Investigational Device Exemption for Ovaprene, we provided an annual report to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") with data collected from the study through September 15, 2025 regarding safety, tolerability and pregnancy experiences. Such data was consistent with the data analyzed by the DSMB during the July 2025 planned interim analysis. We intend to maintain active recruitment at five study sites, supported by grant funding we received in November 2024. We currently anticipate enrollment will be completed in 2026, and plan to provide further updates regarding anticipated enrollment and study completion targets in 2026.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "negative", "score": 0.9980494976043701}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9985761642456055}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999163031578064}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9382312893867493}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9337372779846191}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.8264867067337036}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9512608051300049}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9974648952484131}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994896650314331}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9978285431861877}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.8780490159988403}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.7060185074806213}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9837206602096558}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.998247504234314}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.996478259563446}], "sentiment": "neutral"}, "item 7.01": {"text": "Regulation FD Disclosure.

In accordance with the license agreement, the termination will be effective in February 2026. With the Phase 3 program advancing with non-dilutive grant support, the return of rights will provide Dar with full control of a late-stage asset that is differentiated in a large market with significant unmet need. Late-Stage, First-in-Category Asset consolidation of commercialization rights will strengthen Dar's strategic position as Ovaprene advances through its pivotal Phase 3 clinical study. Ovaprene has the potential to become the first FDA-approved hormone-free, monthly intravaginal contraceptive option available to women, representing a meaningful innovation in a category that has seen limited advancement in decades. view the consolidation of commercial rights under Dar at this stage of Ovaprene's development as value-enhancing for our company,\" said Sabrina Martucci Johnson, President and CEO of Dar Bioscience. \"The Phase 3 study is progressing, supported by non-dilutive funding, and the positive interim data announced in July 2025 underscore the asset's potential. We will have maximum strategic flexibility to capture the value of this opportunity.\" Positive Interim Results Reinforce Clinical and Commercial Potential July 2025, Dar announced positive interim data from the ongoing open-label Phase 3 trial of Ovaprene (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06127199) demonstrating encouraging results including consistent safety and tolerability; no serious safety concerns were identified, and overall tolerability was favorable. The rate of pregnancy in women treated in the study at the time of the interim analysis was consistent with the company's expectations based on the results of the pre-pivotal postcoital test clinical study of Ovaprene. These interim findings support Ovaprene's potential as a meaningful hormone-free alternative. These fundamentals remain unchanged, and the study is progressing toward anticipated completion of enrollment in 2026. ongoing trial is supported by previously announced external grant funding, including the award from Gates Foundation announced in , and continues without any change to timelines or operations. Expanded Strategic Optionality global commercialization rights consolidated at Dar, the company is now positioned to evaluate partnership structures that best reflect the value of a late-stage, non-hormonal contraceptive with differentiation and relevance.

Ovaprene features a proprietary knitted polymer barrier to physically block sperm from entering the cervical canal within a silicone-reinforced ring that releases non-hormonal agent ferrous gluconate to impede sperm motility. Unlike current FDA-approved monthly intravaginal contraceptives, Ovaprene does not contain hormones, but consistent with those monthly intravaginal contraceptives Ovaprene is designed to be a \"one size fits most\" monthly, self-administered product. It is inserted at the end of one menstrual period and left until the beginning of the next, requiring no action at intercourse. It requires no clinician fitting and a new product is used each month. If approved, Ovaprene would represent the first product of its kind for women seeking new options in non-hormonal contraception.

(BUSINESS WIRE) December 1, 2025 Strategy Inc (Nasdaq: STRF/STRC/STRK/STRD/MSTR; LuxSE: STRE) today announced the establishment of a US dollar reserve (\"USD Reserve\") of $1.44 billion and updates to its assumptions underlying its previously issued forward guidance and bitcoin key performance indicator (\"KPI\") targets for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, which were published on October 30, 2025. Establishment of USD Reserve Strategy today announced that it has established a USD Reserve of $1.44 billion to support the payment of dividends on its preferred stock and interest on its outstanding indebtedness (\"Dividends\"). The USD Reserve was funded using proceeds from the sale of shares of class A common stock under Strategy's at-the-market offering program. Strategy's current intention is to maintain a USD Reserve in an amount sufficient to fund at least twelve months of its Dividends, and Strategy intends to strengthen the USD Reserve over time, with the goal of ultimately covering 24 months or more of its Dividends. The maintenance of this USD Reserve, as well as its amount, terms and conditions, remains subject to Strategy's sole and absolute discretion and Strategy may adjust the USD Reserve from time to time based on market conditions, liquidity needs and other factors. \"Establishing a USD Reserve to complement our BTC Reserve marks the next step in our evolution, and we believe it will better position us to navigate short-term market volatility while delivering on our vision of being the world's leading issuer of Digital Credit,\" said Michael Saylor, Founder and Executive Chairman. \"Strategy now holds 650,000 bitcoin, about 3.1% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist. In recognition of the important role we play in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, and to further reinforce our commitment to our credit investors and shareholders, we have established a USD Reserve that currently covers 21 months of Dividends. We intend to use this reserve to pay our Dividends and grow it over time.\" said Phong Le, President and Chief Executive Officer. Updates to FY 2025 Earnings Guidance and Bitcoin KPI Targets Strategy today announced updates to its assumptions underlying its previously issued forward guidance and Bitcoin KPI targets for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025 (\"FY2025\"), previously published on October 30, 2025. That guidance assumed a bitcoin price of $150,000 as of December 31, 2025, based on the approximate consensus midpoint of third-party research analyst year-end bitcoin price estimates available as of that date. Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and the trading price of bitcoin has declined from approximately $111,612 as of October 30, 2025 to as low as $80,660 on November 21, 2025. In light of the recent trading prices of bitcoin, Strategy is updating its assumptions for the price of bitcoin as of year-end 2025 to reflect a range of prices consistent with the recent trading history of bitcoin and is providing corresponding ranges for FY2025 Operating Income, Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share as set forth below that would result if the price of bitcoin on December 31, 2025 is within such range. Update to FY 2025 Earnings Guidance Based on an assumed year-end 2025 bitcoin price range of $85,000 to $110,000, the target ranges for Strategy's FY2025 Operating Income, Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share are as follows: FY2025 Operating Income (Loss): between approximately $(7.0) billion and $9.5 billion; FY2025 Net Income (Loss): between approximately $(5.5) billion and $6.3 billion; and FY2025 Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share: between approximately $(17.0) per share of common stock and $19.0 per share of common stock. These ranges also assume the successful completion of capital raises to achieve Strategy's FY2025 Bitcoin Yield Target (discussed below) and the deployment of proceeds from such raises to the purchase of bitcoin. Strategy has adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08, IntangiblesGoodwill and OtherCrypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets , which requires that Strategy measure its bitcoin holdings at fair value, with gains and losses from changes in the fair value of bitcoin recognized in net income (loss) at each reporting period. As a result, and due to Strategy's significant bitcoin holdings, Strategy's earnings results are extremely sensitive to and directly correlated with changes in the market price of bitcoin. Strategy can provide no assurance or guarantee as to the price of bitcoin as of December 31, 2025, and as a result Strategy's actual results may vary materially from the ranges of results set forth above if the market price of bitcoin as of December 31, 2025 varies materially from this assumed range of bitcoin prices. Strategy this guidance, other than as may be required by applicable law. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this guidance. Updates to FY 2025 Bitcoin KPI Targets Also based on the same assumed year-end 2025 bitcoin price range of $85,000 to $110,000, and after giving effect to Strategy's anticipated common stock issuances to maintain its USD Reserve, Strategy's updated FY2025 Bitcoin KPI targets are as follows: FY2025 BTC Yield Target: between 22.0% and 26.0%; and FY2025 BTC $ Gain Target: between $8.4 billion and $12.8 billion. Strategy expects to achieve these targets through preferred stock offerings, disciplined common stock issuances, and the resulting increase in its bitcoin holdings.

During these meetings, the Company intends to reaffirm its guidance of approximately $12.26 in diluted earnings per common share (\"EPS\") or approximately $17.00 in adjusted earnings per common share (\"Adjusted EPS\"), in each case for the year ending December 31, 2025 (\"FY 2025\"). This guidance is consistent with the guidance issued in the Company's press release dated November 5, 2025. The Company has included Adjusted EPS in this current report, a financial measure that is not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). Management believes that this measure, when presented in conjunction with the comparable measure of GAAP EPS, provides a comprehensive perspective to more accurately compare and analyze the Company's core operating performance over time. Consequently, management uses Adjusted EPS as a consistent and uniform indicator of the Company's core business operations from period to period, as well as for planning and decision-making purposes and in determination of incentive compensation. Adjusted EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP EPS.

(2) We completed the PPI acquisition in March 2025 and the 8th Avenue acquisition in July 2025. The amounts included in cash paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, reflect the cash consideration paid less any cash acquired in the transactions and include $124.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2025 related to the PPI acquisition and $795.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2025 related to the 8th Avenue acquisition. 3) As used herein, EBITDA represents net earnings plus interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. We present EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is commonly reported and frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. In addition, management understands that investors, analysts and rating agencies consider EBITDA useful in measuring the ability of issuers of \"high yield\" securities to meet debt service obligations. Our management believes EBITDA is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity because cash expenditures on interest are, by definition, available to pay interest, and income taxes are inversely correlated to interest expense. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges. The indenture that will govern the notes and the indentures governing our other senior notes and the credit agreement use EBITDA (with additional adjustments similar to those discussed below regarding our calculation of \"Adjusted EBITDA\") to measure our compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence. Our management also believes EBITDA is an accepted indicator of our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. We believe that EBITDA is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: it does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; it does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations, as discussed under \"Adjusted EBITDA\" below; and other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative benchmark measure. Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA only supplementally. The following table reconciles net earnings to EBITDA for the periods indicated: Year Ended September 30, in millions Net earnings 301.0 366.0 335.0 Income tax expense 105.1 108.7 Interest expense, net 279.1 316.5 361.4 Depreciation and amortization 407.1 476.9 524.3 EBITDA 1,087.0 1,265.2 1,330.0 (4) We present Adjusted EBITDA as a further supplemental measure of our operating performance and ability to service debt. We prepare Adjusted EBITDA by adjusting EBITDA to eliminate the impact of a number of items that are non-cash items, unusual items which we do not expect to recur or continue at the same level or other items which we do not believe to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. As an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA, including the fact that we may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than other companies in our industry. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The following table reconciles EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: Year Ended September 30, in millions EBITDA 1,087.2 1,265.2 1,330.1 (Income) expense on swaps, net(a) (39.9) (6.9) (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net(b) (40.5) Impairment of goodwill(c) Stock-based compensation(d) Equity method investment adjustment(e) Mark-to-market adjustments on commodity and foreign exchange hedges and warrant liabilities(f) (7.1) (5.0) Mark-to-market adjustments and impairments on equity securities and investments(g) (3.1) Integration costs(h) Transaction costs(i) Provision for legal settlements(j) Restructuring and facility closure costs, excluding accelerated depreciation(k) Inventory revaluation adjustment on acquired businesses(l) Gain on dissolution of PHPC(m) (10.5) Gain on bargain purchase(n) (10.6) Loss on sale of business(o) Costs expected to be indemnified, net(p) (4.2) Advisory income(q) (0.6) (0.6) (0.5) Noncontrolling interest adjustment(r) (0.3) (0.4) Asset disposal costs(s) Adjusted EBITDA 1,233.4 1,403.6 1,538.8 Represents mark-to-market adjustments and cash settlements on our interest rate swaps.

Represents costs recorded in connection with the disposal of certain assets which were never put into use and/or the demolition and site remediation of unused facilities. (5) \"Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA\" represents a further supplemental measure of our operating performance and ability to service debt. We prepare Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA by further adjusting Adjusted EBITDA to give effect to recent acquisitions as if those acquisitions had occurred on October 1, 2024, as follows: The PPI acquisition was completed effective March 3, 2025. Our results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 include approximately seven months of financial results attributable to PPI. Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 includes management's estimate of the pre-acquisition EBITDA for PPI for the period October 1, 2024 to March 2, 2025. The 8th Avenue acquisition was completed effective July 1, 2025. Our results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 include three months of financial results attributable to 8th Avenue. Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2025 includes management's estimate of the pre-acquisition EBITDA for 8th Avenue for the period October 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025 and does not give effect to our pending pasta business sale. Management's estimates of the pre-acquisition EBITDA of PPI and 8th Avenue, and the other financial data presented in this offering memorandum for such acquisitions, are based on the financial statements that were prepared by their respective prior management and do not include any contributions from synergies or cost savings that our management expects to achieve in the future. EBITDA of PPI and 8th Avenue are based on reasonable assumptions and information management believes to be reliable and accurate and represent management's good faith estimates that are made on the basis of such assumptions and information. These financial statements and the reconciliations below have not been audited or reviewed, examined, compiled or subject to agreed upon procedures by our independent registered public accounting firm. Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X or any other securities laws relating to the presentation of pro forma financial information. Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA and the related ratios are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our actual financial position or results of operations would have been if the acquisition had been completed as of an earlier date or that may be achieved in the future.

Net Debt (as adjusted) is defined as (a) the aggregate principal amount of our indebtedness outstanding of $7,517.2 million (which excludes $78.2 million of leaseback financial liabilities for certain pasta manufacturing facilities that are classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2025 and will be assumed by Richardson as part of the pending pasta business sale) less (b) cash and cash equivalents of $170.8 million, in each case after giving effect to the issuance of the notes offered hereby and the 5.50% notes redemption as if each of the foregoing transactions had occurred on September 30, 2025, and less (c) the current portion of our municipal debt of $1.2 million as of September 30, 2025 and, in the case of cash and cash equivalents, after giving effect to the payment of accrued and unpaid interest and estimated costs, fees and expenses with respect to such transactions. Net Debt (as adjusted) does not give effect to the pending pasta business sale. (7) We present Ratio of Net Debt (as adjusted) to Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA as a further supplemental measure of financial position.

(NASDAQ: AKBA) (\"Akebia\"). \"This transaction strengthens our cash position through additional non-dilutive funding, extending our runway into the second half of 2027, as we remain focused on advancing bempikibart for patients with AA, an indication with significant unmet medical need. We believe bempikibart has tremendous potential to transform the AA treatment paradigm and we look forward to sharing topline data from Part B of the SIGNAL-AA Phase 2a trial, which remains on-track mid-2026,\" said Jodie Morrison, Chief Executive Officer of Q32 Bio. \"We are pleased to transition ownership and continued development of ADX-097 to Akebia, a company focused on developing and commercializing therapies for kidney disease.\" ADX-097, the lead product candidate from Q32 Bio's tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, is a humanized anti-C3d Factor H monoclonal antibody (\"mAb\") fusion protein. ADX-097 is designed to inhibit complement activationan integral part of the innate immune systemthrough a novel, tissue-targeted mechanism with potential in a range of indications associated with C3d deposition including kidney, autoimmune, vascular and skin diseases. Q32 Bio's tissue-targeted complement platform is designed to inhibit complement activation in the tissue while minimizing systemic complement blockade, a key differentiator versus current complement therapeutics. The platform is proprietary to Q32 Bio and developed with foundational science from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. Beyond ADX-097, discovery and earlier development efforts include ADX-096, a C3d mAb CR1 fusion protein with preclinical data supportive of its use in ophthalmologic indications as well as potential utility in a broad range of other indications, and C3d mAb fusions and nanobodies designed for tissue-targeted complement inhibition. Q32 Bio retains the rights to its wholly owned tissue-targeted complement inhibitor platform, including ADX-096 and other remaining early-stage assets and is continuing to evaluate strategic options for these programs. Akebia has acquired ADX-097 and will be responsible for future development and commercialization. Under the terms of the agreement, Q32 Bio will receive $12 million in upfront payments and a near-term milestone, which includes $7 million received at signing, $3 million at the 6-month anniversary of signing, and $2 million payable upon the earlier of the achievement of a milestone or the end of 2026. These payments as well as potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones total up to $592 million. Q32 Bio is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on potential future sales of ADX-097, ranging from low single-digit to mid-teen percentages.

(Nasdaq: AKBA), a biopharmaceutical company with the purpose to better the lives of people impacted by kidney disease, today announced the establishment of its rare kidney disease pipeline. The pipeline is comprised of two core product candidates: ADX-097, a potential next generation complement inhibitor (now referred to as AKB-097) and praliciguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator. Akebia acquired all rights to AKB-097, a tissue-targeted C3d-Factor H fusion protein complement inhibitor, from Q32 Bio Inc. (Nasdaq: QTTB) and believes AKB-097 has applicability across a wide range of complement-mediated rare kidney diseases. AKB-097 is targeted to the sites of complement activation in tissues and is not expected to result in systemic complement inhibition seen with other inhibitors. Separately, Akebia is evaluating praliciguat initially in a clinical trial in the treatment of FSGS, a rare kidney disease, and also plans to assess its use in other rare podocytopathies. \"Our commitment to patients with kidney disease is supported by two pillars of our corporate strategy: first, to drive Vafseo to become standard of care in anemia due to CKD in dialysis, and second, to build and progress our kidney disease pipeline,\" said John P. Butler, Chief Executive Officer of Akebia. \"While our commercial and medical teams continue to build on the momentum of our Vafseo launch, we are excited to take an important step forward as a company with the establishment of our rare kidney disease development pipeline. We believe our differentiated complement inhibitor program can play a key role in addressing numerous rare kidney diseases, as can praliciguat, which we intend to initially study in FSGS. We look forward to enrolling patients in Phase 2 trials with each product candidate next year and expect to begin generating clinical data from an AKB-097 Phase 2 basket trial beginning in 2027.\" About Complement Inhibition and AKB-097 The body's complement system, a series of proteins that work together as part of the immune system, can become dysregulated resulting in numerous inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, including multiple diseases of the kidney. Complement inhibitors work by binding to and preventing the activation of specific complement proteins, halting the cascade of inflammatory responses and reducing the destruction of cells. Exhibit 99.1 AKB-097 is a humanized anti-C3d monoclonal antibody (mAb) fusion protein designed to act as a complement inhibitor through a tissue-targeted mechanism. AKB-097 has the potential to drive improved clinical activity by achieving therapeutic levels of inhibition and to address the limitations of the currently available systemic approaches to complement inhibition, including infection risk and the need for high drug doses and frequent administration. In preclinical studies conducted by Q32 Bio, AKB-097 distributed to affected tissues/organs and demonstrated durable tissue pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties. AKB-097 was shown to be well-tolerated and demonstrated minimal anti-drug antibodies in a completed Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. Akebia is planning to initiate an open label Phase 2 basket study in the second half of 2026 with initial data generation expected in 2027. Financial Terms of Asset Purchase Agreement On November 28, 2025, Akebia and Q32 Bio signed an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) under which Akebia acquired global rights to Q32 Bio's ADX-097 (now referred to as AKB-097). In consideration, Akebia paid Q32 Bio an upfront payment of $7.0 million. Akebia will also make a $3.0 million payment upon the six-month anniversary of the closing, as well as additional development and regulatory milestones, commercial milestones and tiered royalties on annual net sales of AKB-097. About Praliciguat and Planned Phase 2 Trial in FSGS Praliciguat, is an oral soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) licensed by Akebia from Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc. in June 2021. No significant safety issues were observed with praliciguat in Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and Phase 2 studies in heart failure and diabetic kidney disease. Praliciguat adverse events were infrequent and consistent with its known blood pressure lowering effect. Akebia filed its Investigational New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recently initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial in FSGS. The Phase 2 clinical trial is expected to enroll up to 60 patients at U.S. sites. The primary efficacy endpoint is change in urine protein-to-creatinine ratio between baseline and Week 24. FSGS is a chronic disease characterized by scarring in some parts of the kidney's filtering units known as glomeruli. Left untreated, FSGS can cause various symptoms including high cholesterol, high blood pressure and kidney failure. FSGS is heterogenous with a wide range of causes and symptoms among those impacted and has been diagnosed in approximately 40,000 people in the U.S. No treatments specifically indicated for FSGS are currently on the market and most patients are treated with antihypertensives and non-specific immunosuppressive therapies. Exhibit 99.1 About Akebia Therapeutics Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with the purpose to better the lives of people impacted by kidney disease. Akebia was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. For more information, please visit our website at www.akebia.com, which does not form a part of this release. About Vafseo (vadadustat) tablets Vafseo (vadadustat) tablets is a once-daily oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that activates the physiologic response to hypoxia to stimulate endogenous production of erythropoietin, increasing hemoglobin and red blood cell production to manage anemia. Vafseo is approved for use in 37 countries. INDICATION VAFSEO is indicated for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults who have been receiving dialysis for at least three months. Limitations of Use VAFSEO has not been shown to improve quality of life, fatigue, or patient well-being. VAFSEO is not indicated for use: As a substitute for red blood cell transfusions in patients who require immediate correction of anemia. In patients with anemia due to CKD not on dialysis. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION about VAFSEO (vadadustat) tablets WARNING: INCREASED RISK OF DEATH, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, and THROMBOSIS OF VASCULAR ACCESS. VAFSEO increases the risk of thrombotic vascular events, including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Targeting a hemoglobin level greater than 11 g/dL is expected to further increase the risk of death and arterial and venous thrombotic events, as occurs with erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs), which also increase erythropoietin levels. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, dose of VAFSEO, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Use the lowest dose of VAFSEO sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity to VAFSEO or any of its components Uncontrolled hypertension Exhibit 99.1 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Risk of Death, Myocardial Infarction (MI), Stroke, Venous Thromboembolism, and Thrombosis of Vascular Access A rise in hemoglobin (Hb) levels greater than 1 g/dL over 2 weeks can increase these risks. Avoid in patients with a history of MI, cerebrovascular event, or acute coronary syndrome within the 3 months prior to starting VAFSEO. Targeting a Hb level of greater than 11 g/dL is expected to further increase the risk of death and arterial and venous thrombotic events. Use the lowest effective dose to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. Adhere to dosing and Hb monitoring recommendations to avoid excessive erythropoiesis. Hepatotoxicity Hepatocellular injury attributed to VAFSEO was reported in less than 1% of patients, including one severe case with jaundice. Elevated serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels were observed in 1.8%, 1.8%, and 0.3% of CKD patients treated with VAFSEO, respectively. Measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin before treatment and monthly for the first 6 months, then as clinically indicated. Discontinue VAFSEO if ALT or AST is persistently elevated or accompanied by elevated bilirubin. Not recommended in patients with cirrhosis or active, acute liver disease. Hypertension Worsening of hypertension was reported in 14% of VAFSEO and 17% of darbepoetin alfa patients. Serious worsening of hypertension was reported in 2.7% of VAFSEO and 3% of darbepoetin alfa patients. Cases of hypertensive crisis, including hypertensive encephalopathy and seizures, have also been reported in patients receiving VAFSEO. Monitor blood pressure. Adjust anti-hypertensive therapy as needed. Seizures Seizures occurred in 1.6% of VAFSEO and 1.6% of darbepoetin alfa patients. Monitor for new-onset seizures, premonitory symptoms, or change in seizure frequency. Gastrointestinal (GI) Erosion Gastric or esophageal erosions occurred in 6.4% of VAFSEO and 5.3% of darbepoetin alfa patients. Serious GI erosions, including GI bleeding and the need for RBC transfusions, were reported in 3.4% of VAFSEO and 3.3% of darbepoetin alfa patients. Consider this risk in patients at increased risk of GI erosion. Advise patients about signs of erosions and GI bleeding and urge them to seek prompt medical care if present. Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Anemia Due to CKD and Not on Dialysis The safety of VAFSEO has not been established for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adults not on dialysis and its use is not recommended in this setting. In large clinical trials in adults with anemia of CKD who were not on dialysis, an increased risk of mortality, stroke, MI, serious acute kidney injury, serious hepatic injury, and serious GI erosions was observed in patients treated with VAFSEO compared to darbepoetin alfa. Exhibit 99.1 Malignancy VAFSEO has not been studied and is not recommended in patients with active malignancies. Malignancies were observed in 2.2% of VAFSEO and 3.0% of darbepoetin alfa patients. No evidence of increased carcinogenicity was observed in animal studies. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (occurring at 10%) were hypertension and diarrhea. DRUG INTERACTIONS Iron supplements and iron-containing phosphate binders: Administer VAFSEO at least 1 hour before products containing iron. Non-iron-containing phosphate binders : Administer VAFSEO at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after non-iron-containing phosphate binders. BCRP substrates : Monitor for signs of substrate adverse reactions and consider dose reduction. Statins : Monitor for statin-related adverse reactions. Limit the daily dose of simvastatin to 20 mg and rosuvastatin to 5 mg. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: May cause fetal harm.

(Nasdaq: XERS), a fast-growing biopharmaceutical company committed to improving patient lives by developing and commercializing innovative products across a range of therapies, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued a Notice of Allowance for its subsidiary Xeris Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s U.S. patent application covering XP-8121, one of its novel product candidates. The Notice of Allowance indicates that the USPTO has determined the application meets the requirements for patentability and is expected to issue as a U.S. patent following standard administrative steps. The allowed claims in this application are specific to the XP-8121 formulation. In parallel, Xeris continues to pursue additional layers of U.S. and international IP protection in the levothyroxine (LT4) technology space. \"We believe XP-8121 has tremendous potential to solve an unmet medical need for hypothyroidism, and this patent represents a key milestone in strengthening our intellectual property protection around this important pipeline program,\" said John Shannon, Chief Executive Officer. \"It further demonstrates the ability of our XeriSol platform to enable the development of difficult-to-formulate drugs into subcutaneous injections.\" About XP-8121 XP-8121 is an investigational, ready-to-use liquid formulation of levothyroxine sodium designed for once-weekly subcutaneous injection using Xeris' proprietary XeriSol technology. By avoiding the gastrointestinal tract, XP-8121 may address the well-documented limitations of oral levothyroxine, including variable absorption, drug and food interactions, and inconsistent therapeutic effect. About Xeris Xeris (Nasdaq: XERS) is a fast-growing biopharmaceutical Company committed to improving patient lives by developing and commercializing innovative products across a range of therapies. Xeris has three commercially available products: Recorlev, for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome; Gvoke, a ready-to-use liquid glucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia, and a gastrointestinal motility inhibitor when used as a diagnostic aid; and Keveyis, a proven therapy for primary periodic paralysis. Xeris also has a pipeline of development programs led by XP-8121, a Phase 3-ready, once-weekly subcutaneous injection for hypothyroidism, as well as early-stage programs leveraging Xeris' technology platforms, XeriSol and XeriJect, for its partners.

(NYSE: PLNT) (together with its subsidiaries, the \"Company\") today announced that certain of its subsidiaries intend to complete a refinancing transaction, which will include the issuance of a new series of securitized debt under their existing securitized financing facility and repayment of their existing Series 2022-1 Class A-2-I Notes. The Company expects that these subsidiaries will also enter into a $75 million variable funding note facility, in addition to the existing $75 million 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1. As of September 30, 2025, there were no borrowings outstanding under the existing variable funding notes facility.

The net proceeds of the securitized financing facility are expected to be used: to repay in full the Series 2022-1 Class A-2-I Notes, which as of September 30, 2025, had a principal balance of approximately $410 million; to pay the transaction costs and fund the reserve accounts associated with the securitized financing facility; and for general corporate purposes, which may include funding share repurchases by the Company. The consummation of the offering is subject to market and other conditions and is anticipated to close in December 2025. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully complete the refinancing transaction on the terms described or at all. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes or any other security. The Notes to be offered have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2025 (Expressed in United States Dollars) Independent Auditor's Report the Shareholders of BriaPro Therapeutics Corp.: Opinion have audited the consolidated financial statements of BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\"), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, and the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholder's equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information. our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as at July 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Basis for Opinion conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audits of the consolidated financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern draw attention to Note 1(c) in the consolidated financial statements, which indicates that the Company incurred losses of $1,180,425 since incorporation, is currently in the pre clinical research stage and has not commenced commercial operations. The Company expects to incur further losses through to the completion of the research and development of any therapy. As stated in Note 1(c), these events or conditions, along with other matters as set forth in Note 1(c), indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. Burnhamthorpe Road West, Suite 900, Mississauga ON, L5B 3C 416.626.6000 F: 416.626.8650 MNP.ca Audit Matters audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Except for the matter described in the Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern section, we have determined that there are no other key audit matters to communicate in our report. Other Information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises Management's Discussion and Analysis. opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audits or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. We obtained Management's Discussion and Analysis prior to the date of this auditor's report. If, based on the work we have performed on this other information, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2025 AND 2024 (Expressed in US Dollars) 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. (\"BriaPro\" or the \"Company\") was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on May 15, 2023. Following the completion of the Arrangement (as defined below), BriaPro is a pre-clinical immuno-oncology biotechnology company with multiple assets, specifically Bria-TILsRxTM, and PKC inhibitors for multiple indications including cancer. The Company's head office is located at 235 15 Street, Suite 300, West Vancouver B.C, V7T 2X1, Canada. The Company is an unlisted reporting issuer in Canada. August 31, 2023 (the \"Effective Date\"), the Company and BriaCell Therapeutics Corp, the Company's holding company, and immune-oncology biotechnology company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (\"BriaCell\"), closed a plan of arrangement spinout transaction (the \"Arrangement\") pursuant to which certain assets of the BriaCell, including Bria-TILsRxTM and protein kinase C delta (PKC) inhibitors for multiple indications including cancer (the \"BriaPro Assets\"), were spun-out to the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement, the Company has acquired the entire right and interest in and to the BriaPro Assets in consideration for the issuance by the Company to BriaCell of the Company's common shares. Under the terms of the Arrangement, for each BriaCell share held immediately prior to closing, BriaCell Shareholders receive one (1) common share of BriaPro. addition, in connection with the Arrangement, each BriaCell warrant in issue at the time of the Arrangement entitled the holder thereof to receive, upon the exercise thereof one BriaCell Share and one BriaPro Share for the original exercise price (\"Warrant Shares\"), see note 5(c). a result of the Arrangement, 47,945,177 common shares were issued and outstanding and 2,131,400 stock options and 19,100 RSUs were issued. BriaCell beneficially owns or controls approximately 31,963,452 common shares, representing 2/3rd of the issued and outstanding common shares. accordance with IFRS, management determined that the Arrangement does not meet the definition of a business combination as the BriaPro Assets met the concentration test. Further, management asserts that BriaPro had not yet achieved commercial operations and was still in the Research stage at the time of the Arrangement (hence there were no significant inputs, processes and outputs as defined in IFRS 3 as characteristics of a business). Consequently, the Transaction has been recorded as an asset acquisition and the Company recorded the carrying value of the intangible assets acquired from BriaCell. shares, options and RSUs issued on the Effective Date along with the Warrant Share obligation are considered as part of the transaction. The carrying value of the BriaPro Assets at the Effective Date were $213,800. The warrants will be recorded as a liability at their fair value on the Effective Date, and revalued at reach reporting period. The options and RSUs will be recorded at their fair value on the Effective Date in the share based payments reserve and the balance will be recorded in share capital. table below summarizes the breakdown of the consideration at the Effective date: August 31, 2023 Value of the asset (patent) transferred 213,800 Accumulated Deficit (19,921 Warrants 199,207 Options and RSUs 34,514 Total consideration paid 213,800 BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2025 AND 2024 (Expressed in US Dollars) 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN (Cont.) Transition Services Agreement August 31, 2023, the Company and BriaPro executed a transition services agreement (the \"Transition Agreement\"), pursuant to which BriaCell will provide certain research and development and head office services (the \"Services\") to BriaPro for a fixed monthly fee of $20,000. BriaCell and BriaPro acknowledged the transitional nature of the Services and accordingly, as promptly as practicable, BriaPro agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to transition each Service to its own internal organization or to obtain alternate third party providers to provide the Services. accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses of $1,180,425 since incorporation, is currently in the pre-clinical research stage and has not commenced commercial operations. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to attain future profitable operations and to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The Company expects to incur further losses through to the completion of the research and development of any therapy; the nature of a development stage immune-oncology company requires the raising of financial capital to support its clinical development programs and administrative costs. The Company is planning to finance its operations by exploring additional sources of capital and financing, while managing its existing working capital resources. Until the Company raises additional financing, it is entirely dependent on BriaCell to finance the Company's operations. The material uncertainty of the Company's ability to raise such financial capital casts significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern. 2: BASIS OF PRESENTATION Statement of Compliance: Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards (\"IFRS\"), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\") and interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee, effective as of July 31, 2025. Basis of presentation Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis and have been presented in United States dollars which is the Company's reporting currency. A summary of the material accounting policies is provided in Note 3. BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2025 AND 2024 (Expressed in US Dollars) 2: BASIS OF PRESENTATION (Cont.) Basis of Measurement: These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost basis, except for financial instruments which have been measured at fair value. Basis of Consolidation These Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of BriaPro and its wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary BriaIP Therapeutics Corp. (\"BriaIP\"), incorporated on August 28, 2023. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the subsidiary are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commenced until the date control ceases. Control exists when the Company has the power directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The Company applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3. intercompany balances, and transactions, have been eliminated upon consolidation. Functional Currency and Presentation Currency: functional currency is the currency that best reflects the economic environment in which the Company operates and conducts its transactions. Significantly all the Company's expenses are denominated in U.S dollars and therefore, the Company's management believes that the functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The determination of the Company's functional and presentation currency represents a significant judgment. Accordingly, monetary accounts maintained in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into U.S. dollars at each reporting period end. All transaction gains and losses of the remeasured monetary financial position items are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss as financing income or expenses as appropriate. 3: MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Material Accounting Judgment and Estimates: accounting policies and use of estimates and judgments described below have been applied consistently in these Consolidated Financial Statements. preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The Company's management believes that the estimates, judgment and assumptions used are reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2025 AND 2024 (Expressed in US Dollars) 3: MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.) areas of significant judgments and estimation uncertainty include: Intangible Assets: The useful lives of intangible assets are estimated based on historical experience and management's best estimate of the future economic benefits that will be derived from the use of the assets. The assessment of whether intangible assets are impaired requires estimates of recoverable amounts, which involve assumptions about future cash flows and discount rates. Warrant Liabilities: The fair value of warrant liabilities is determined using valuation techniques appropriate for financial instruments, including assumptions such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rates, expected life, and market prices of underlying shares. These assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary at each reporting date. The share price for determining the value of the warrant liability was determined by using the discounted cash flow method, including assumptions relating to future cash flows, an appropriate discount rate and growth rate and royalty rate. Warrant liabilities are remeasured at fair value at each reporting date, with any gains or losses recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Going Concern: Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements is on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and payments of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, it may be unable to realize the carrying value of its assets, including its intangible assets and to meet its liabilities as they become due. Income Taxes: Provisions for taxes are made using the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. The Company reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end of the reporting period. However, it is possible that at some future date an additional liability could result from audits by taxing authorities. Where the final outcome of these tax-related matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will affect the tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. includes cash on hand. Share-based Payments Equity-settled share-based payments for directors, officers and employees are measured at fair value at the date of grant and recorded as compensation expense over the vesting period with a corresponding increase to share-based payment reserve in the consolidated financial statements. fair value determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed using the graded vesting method over the vesting period based on the Company's estimate of payments that will eventually vest. Upon exercise of the stock options, consideration paid by the option holder together with the amount previously recognized in share-based payment reserve is recorded as an increase to share capital. Upon expiry, the amounts recorded for share-based compensation are transferred to the deficit from the share-based payment reserve. Shares are issued from treasury upon the exercise of equity-settled share-based instruments. BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2025 AND 2024 (Expressed in US Dollars) 3: MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.) Compensation expense on stock options granted to non-employees is measured at the earlier of the completion of performance and the date the options are vested using the fair value method and is recorded as an expense in the same period as if the Company had paid cash for the goods or services received. the value of goods or services received in exchange for the share-based payment cannot be reliably estimated, the fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected life used in the model is adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioral considerations. Share Capital Common shares are classified as equity. Proceeds from unit placements are allocated between shares and warrants issued using the relative fair value method. Costs directly identifiable with share capital financing are charged against share capital. Share issuance costs incurred in advance of share subscriptions are recorded as prepaid assets. Share issuance costs related to uncompleted share subscriptions are charged to operations in the period they are incurred. Intangible assets, net: Separately acquired intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost including directly attributable costs. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Expenditures relating to internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalized development costs, are recognized in consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss when incurred. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for indications of impairment at least annually. Impairment analysis is completed whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The recoverability of the group of assets is measured to be the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using pre-tax discount rate. An impairment loss is recognized If the carrying amount of an asset or the lowest level of cash generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset are reviewed at least at each year end. useful lives of intangible assets are as follows: Patents Useful years Amortization method Straight-line In-house development or purchase Purchase the period ended July 31, 2025, no impairment losses have been identified. BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2025 AND 2024 (Expressed in US Dollars) 3: MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.) Research and Development expenses: Company expenses amounts paid for intellectual property, development and production expenditures as they are incurred. However, such costs are deferred and recorded in intangible assets when they meet generally accepted criteria, to the extent that their recovery can reasonably be regarded as assured. costs must meet the following criteria to be deferred: the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale; the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; the ability to use or sell the intangible asset; the probability of future economic benefits; the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset; and the ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Once those criteria are met, the future costs, such as costs to obtain patent or trademark protection over the developed technologies, will be capitalized. These costs are then amortized over their expected useful lives. To date it has not been demonstrated that these expenditures will generate or be able to be used to generate probable future economic benefits. Fair value of financial instruments: Classification Company determines the classification of financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition. The classification of its instruments is driven by the Company's business model for managing the financial assets and liabilities and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Equity instruments that are held for trading (including all equity derivative instruments) are classified as fair value through profit and loss (\" FVTPL \"). For other equity instruments, on the day of acquisition the Company can make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate them at fair value through other comprehensive income (\"FVTOCI\"). Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, unless they are required to be measured at FVTPL (such as instruments held for trading or derivatives) or the Company has opted to measure them at FVTPL. following table shows the classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9: Financial asset/liability Classification and cash equivalents Amortized Amounts dure to related parties Amortized Accrued expenses and other payables Amortized Warrant Liability FVTPL Measurement Financial assets and liabilities at amortized cost Financial assets and liabilities at amortized cost are initially recognized at fair value plus or minus transaction costs, respectively, and subsequently carried at amortized cost less any impairment. BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2025 AND 2024 (Expressed in US Dollars) 3: MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.) Fair value of financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities at FVTPL Financial assets and liabilities carried at FVTPL are initially recorded at fair value and transaction costs are expensed in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities held at FVTPL are included in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period in which they arise. Where the Company has opted to recognize a financial liability at FVTPL, any changes associated with the Company's own credit risk will be recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). Impairment of financial assets at amortized cost Company recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets that are measured at amortized cost. At each reporting date, the Company measures the loss allowance for the financial asset at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition. If at the reporting date, the financial asset has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Company measures the loss allowance for the financial asset at an amount equal to twelve month expected credit losses. The Company recognizes an impairment gain or loss, the amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recognized. value measurement value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement is based on the assumption that the transaction will take place in the assets or the liability's principal market, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market. fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. assets and liabilities measured at fair value or for which fair value is disclosed are categorized into levels within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the entire fair value measurement: Level quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly. Level inputs that are not based on observable market data (valuation techniques which use inputs that are not based on observable market data). BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2025 AND 2024 (Expressed in US Dollars) 3: MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.) Income Taxes: Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the income tax is also recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are only offset if a legally enforceable right exists to offset the amounts and the Company intends to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all qualifying temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax is determined on a non-discounted basis using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset or liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that the assets can be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent future recovery is probable. At each reporting period end, deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable earnings will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Standards not yet effective: There are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB that are effective in future accounting periods that the Company has decided not to adopt early. 9 requires entities to recognize financial assets and liabilities when they become party to the contractual terms and to measure them initially at fair value, adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs where applicable. The standard is being clarified to provide better guidance on the derecognition of financial liabilities, which can impact bank reconciliation processes, especially during debt restructuring based on the timing of payments on financial liabilities as compared to the actual settlement of those debts. This clarification may result in a change in the derecognition timing of financial liabilities in situations where electronic payments are involved. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of this clarification of IFRS 9 will have on its financial statements. The amendments are effective for annual periods starting on or after January 1, 2026. Retrospective application is required and early adoption is permitted. April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements. This standard aims to improve the consistency and clarity of financial statement presentation and disclosures by providing updated guidance on the structure and content of financial statements. Key changes include enhanced requirements for the presentation of financial performance, financial position, and cash flows, as well as additional disclosures to improve transparency and comparability. In addition, IFRS 18 requires entities to classify income and expenses into five categories, three of which are new i.e. operating, investing and financing and the income tax and discontinued operation categories. The new standard sets out detailed requirements for classifying income and expenses into each category. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of IFRS 18 will have on its financial statements. Company is currently assessing the impact of these new accounting standards since there not adopted yet. Company does not expect any other standards issued by the IASB, but not yet effective, to have a material impact on the Company. BriaPro Therapeutics Corp.

For the year ended July 31, 2025, the Company recorded a loss on the revaluation of the total warrant liability of $32,102 in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. key inputs used in the valuation of the of the warrants as of July 31, 2025 were as follows: July 31, July 31, Share price (*) 0.0365 0.0365 Exercise price 0.0206-0.0318 0.0206-0.0318 Expected life (years) 1.30-2.35 0.30-1.35 Volatility 78-81 157-209 Dividend yield Risk free rate 2.68-2.74 The share price was determined using the discounted cash flow method. Key assumptions included discount rate from 14.50% to 16.50% ,a probability adjustment to cash flows ranging from 5% to 100% based on the developmental pre-clinical or clinical trial phase the company would be at a given time and a growth rate of 5%, a royalty rate of 3%, clinical trials taking approximately 8 years. A 1% increase or decrease in enterprise value would result in an approximate +/- $0.00036 change in the share price, which would correspond to an estimated impact of approximately +/- $2,430 on the warrant value. 6: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making operating and financial decisions.

Unless otherwise noted, it is management's opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments. The fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying values, unless otherwise noted. Management understands that the Company is exposed to financial risk arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates as a portion of the Company's transactions occur in Canadian Dollars, and the Company's functional and presentation currency is the US dollar. The Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. The Board of Directors approves and monitors the risk management process. The overall objectives of the Board are to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Company's competitiveness and flexibility. type of risk exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed is as follows: Credit Company has no significant concentration of credit risk arising from operations. Management believes that the credit risk concentration with respect to financial instruments is remote. BriaPro Therapeutics Corp.

As of July 31, 2025, a 5% depreciation or appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar would not have a material effect on the in total loss and comprehensive loss.

Ronan Kennedy, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The term of the Agreement commenced on November 28, 2025 and expires three years thereafter and may be extended for additional one-year periods unless terminated. The Company will pay Mr. Kennedy a base salary of $340,000. The Company also granted Mr. Kennedy a restricted stock award for 445,000 shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to the Company's 2025 Equity Compensation Plan (the \"2025 Plan\") disclosed below. The vesting and issuance of the shares is subject to shareholder approval. The description of the Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Agreement filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 which is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02. On November 28, 2025, the board of directors of the Company approved the 2025 Plan, as the Company's 2015 Equity Compensation Plan has expired and there is a nominal number of shares available under the Company's 2021 Equity Compensation Plan. Our board of directors will recommend that the 2025 Plan be approved by our shareholders at our upcoming 2026 annual meeting. The purpose of the 2025 Plan is to enable the Company to offer to its employees, officers, directors and consultants whose past, present and/or potential contributions to the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, are or will be important to the success of the Company, an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. The 2025 Plan reserves 891,316 shares of our common stock for issuance pursuant to the terms of the plan upon the grant of plan options, restricted stock awards, or other stock-based awards granted under the 2025 Plan. The 2025 Plan also contains an \"evergreen formula\" pursuant to which the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2025 Plan will automatically increase on October 1 of each calendar year during the term of the 2025 Plan, beginning with calendar year 2026, (i) by an amount equal to 2% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on September 30 of the such calendar year, up to a maximum of 300,000 shares or (ii) to no more than 10% of the then number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock as of the date of such increase. The 2025 Plan will be administered by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of our board of directors. Such committee is comprised of independent member of our board of directors in accordance with the rules of the NYSE American LLC, the exchange on which our common stock is presently listed. The Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will determine, from time to time, those of individuals to whom stock awards or plan options will be granted, the terms and provisions of each such grant, the dates such grants will become exercisable, the number of shares subject to each grant, the purchase price of such shares and the form of payment of such purchase price. All other questions relating to the administration of the 2025 Plan and the interpretation of the provisions thereof are to be resolved at the sole discretion of the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The 2025 Plan provides for the grant of restricted stock awards, deferred stock grants, stock appreciation rights, incentive stock options (\"ISOs\") and non-qualified stock options (\"NQOs\"). Awards may be made or granted to our employees, officers, directors and consultants who are deemed to have rendered or to be able to render significant services to the Company or our subsidiaries and who are deemed to have contributed or to have the potential to contribute to the success of our company. Any plan option granted under the 2025 Plan must provide for an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of such grant, but the exercise price of any ISO granted to an eligible employee owning more than 10% of our common stock must be at least 110% of such fair market value as determined on the date of the grant. No ISOs may be granted to any person who is not an employee of the Company or a subsidiary at the time of grant. The recipient of any grant under the 2025 Plan, and the amount and terms of a specific grant, will be determined by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The term of each plan option will be fixed by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee; provided, however , that an ISO may be granted only within the 10-year period commencing from the date of adoption of the 2025 Plan by our board of directors and may only be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant, or five years in the case of an ISO granted to an optionee who, at the time of grant, owns shares of our common stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company. The exercise price per share of common stock purchasable under a plan option will be determined by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee at the time of grant and may not be less than 100% of the fair market value on the day of grant, or, in the case of a grant of an ISO to a 10% or greater shareholder, not be less than 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. provided, however Shares of restricted stock may be awarded either alone or in addition to other awards granted under the 2025 Plan. The Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, subject to board of directors authorization, if indicated, may determine the eligible persons to whom, and the time or times at which, grants of restricted stock will be awarded, the number of shares to be awarded, the price (if any) to be paid by the holder, the time or times within which such awards may be subject to forfeiture, the vesting schedule and rights to acceleration thereof, and all other terms and conditions of the awards. Restricted stock will constitute issued and outstanding shares of our common stock for all corporate purposes. The holder will have the right to vote such restricted stock, to receive and retain all regular cash dividends and other cash equivalent distributions as the board of directors may in its sole discretion designate, pay or distribute on such restricted stock and to exercise all other rights, powers and privileges of a holder of common stock with respect to such restricted stock, with the exceptions that (i) the holder will not be entitled to delivery of the stock certificate or certificates representing such restricted stock until the restriction period, if any, has expired and unless all other vesting requirements with respect thereto shall have been fulfilled; (ii) the Company will retain custody of the stock certificate or certificates representing the restricted stock during the restriction period; (iii) other than regular cash dividends and other cash equivalent distributions as the board of directors may in its sole discretion designate, pay or distribute, we will retain custody of all distributions made or declared with respect to the restricted stock until such time, if ever, as the restricted stock with respect to which such retained distributions may be made, paid or declared has become vested; (iv) such award has not been forfeited. Other stock-based awards may be awarded, subject to limitations under applicable law, that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, or related to, shares of common stock, as deemed by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the 2025 Plan, including, without limitation, purchase rights, shares of common stock awarded which are not subject to any restrictions or conditions, or other rights convertible into shares of common stock and awards valued by reference to the value of securities of or the performance of specified subsidiaries. Other stock-based awards may be awarded either alone or in addition to or in tandem with any other awards under the 2025 Plan or any other plan of the Company. Each other stock-based award will be subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The 2025 Plan became effective on the date of its adoption by our board of directors. To the extent that the 2025 Plan authorizes the award of ISOs, the failure to obtain shareholder approval for the 2025 Plan by November 28, 2025 does not invalidate the 2025 Plan; provided, however , that (i) in the absence of such shareholder approval, ISOs may not be awarded under the 2025 Plan and (ii) any ISOs previously awarded under the 2025 Plan will automatically be converted into NQOs upon terms and conditions determined by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to reflect, as nearly as is reasonably practicable in its sole determination, the terms and conditions of the ISOs so converted. Furthermore, grants under the 2025 Plan will not vest until shareholder approval is received. Our board of directors may at any time, and from time to time, amend alter, suspend or discontinue any of the provisions of the 2025 Plan, but no amendment, alteration, suspension or discontinuance may be made that would impair the rights of a holder of any outstanding grant or award under the 2025 without such holder's consent. Unless the 2025 Plan is suspended or terminated by the board of directors, the 2025 Plan will terminate 10 years from the date of its adoption. Any termination of the 2025 Plan will not affect the validity of any options previously granted thereunder.

If the plan is accepted, the Staff may grant the Company an extension period of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the deficiency notice to regain compliance. There can be no assurance that the Staff will accept the Company's plan to regain compliance with the Stockholders' Equity Requirement, or, if accepted, that the Company will evidence compliance with the Stockholders' Equity Requirement during any extension period that the Staff may grant. If the Staff does not accept the Company's plan, the Company will have an opportunity to appeal the decision to a hearings panel.

As previously reported, on September 1, 2025, Air Lease Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\" or \"Air Lease\"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\"), with Sumisho Air Lease Corporation Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Gladiatora Designated Activity Company), an Irish private limited company (\"Parent\"), and Takeoff Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\"Merger Sub\"), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent is a new holding company established by Sumitomo Corporation, a Japanese corporation (\"Sumitomo\"), SMBC Aviation Capital Limited, a company incorporated with limited liability in Ireland (\"SMBC AC\"), affiliates of Apollo Capital Management, L.P. (\"Apollo\") and affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. (\"Brookfield\" and, together with Apollo, SMBC and Sumitomo, the \"Equity Investors\"). Explanatory Note On October 15, 2025, the Company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A (the \"Preliminary Proxy Statement\") in connection with the special meeting of the Company's Class A common stockholders scheduled to be held on December 18, 2025 (the \"Special Meeting\") to, among other things, consider and vote on a proposal to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement. On November 4, 2025, the Company filed with the SEC a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A (as supplemented from time to time, the \"Definitive Proxy Statement\"), which the Company first mailed to its Class A common stockholders on or about November 7, 2025. The Company is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to update and supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement. 8-K On November 12, 2025, a purported Class A common stockholder of the Company (the \"Delaware Plaintiff\") filed a lawsuit against the Company and each member of the Company's Board of Directors in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (the \"Delaware Complaint\"). The Delaware Complaint, captioned Bingham v. Air Lease Corp. , C.A. No. 2025-1308-BWD (Del. Ch. 2025), asserts claims under Delaware law for breach of fiduciary duties against each member of the Company's Board of Directors related to alleged materially misleading and/or incomplete disclosures in the Definitive Proxy Statement concerning the Company's financial projections, the analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan, discussions about post-transaction employment and prior representations by the Company's legal advisor of Brookfield. The Delaware Plaintiff also seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent the Company from proceeding with holding the Class A common stockholder vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. Bingham v. Air Lease Corp. 2025-1308-BWD On November 24, 2025, two purported Class A common stockholders of the Company filed separate lawsuits against the Company and each member of the Company's Board of Directors in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in New York County (the \"New York Complaints\" and together with the Delaware Complaint, the \"Complaints\"). The New York Complaints, captioned Williams v. Air Lease Corp. , No. 659969/2025 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2025) and Thomas v. Air Lease Corp. , No. 659966/2025 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2025), respectively, each assert claims under New York common law for negligent misrepresentation and concealment and general negligence, concerning the Definitive Proxy Statement, including allegedly misleading and/or incomplete disclosures concerning the Company's financial projections, the analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan, discussions about post-transaction employment and concurrent representations by the Company's financial advisor and its affiliates of Appollo and its affiliates. The New York Complaints also seek to enjoin the merger until supplemental disclosures to the Definitive Proxy Statement are made. Williams v. Air Lease Corp. Thomas v. Air Lease Corp. The Company has also received multiple demand letters from counsel representing purported Class A common stockholders of the Company since the filing of the Preliminary Proxy Statement on October 15, 2025. These demand letters allege that the Preliminary Proxy Statement or the Definitive Proxy Statement violates applicable federal or state law and contains materially misleading and/or incomplete disclosures concerning, among other things, the Company's financial projections, the analyses conducted by the Company's financial advisors, the personal or business relationships between the directors and executives of the Company and those of the Equity Investors and the prior representations by the Company's legal advisor of Brookfield. These demand letters request that the Company issue supplemental disclosures to the Definitive Proxy Statement. 2 While the Company believes that the disclosures in the Definitive Proxy Statement comply fully with all applicable laws, denies the allegations in the Complaints described above and believes they are without merit, in order to moot the allegations and any potential claims regarding disclosures, avoid nuisance and possible expense and business delays, and provide additional information to its Class A common stockholders, the Company has determined voluntarily to supplement certain disclosures in the Definitive Proxy Statement related to the Complaints' and the demand letters' allegations with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the \"Supplemental Disclosures\"). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal merit, necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein.

Certain of these transactions may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the proposed merger. However, the selected transactions were chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan's analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed merger. Based on the results of this analysis , and after excluding the transactions for which the P/BV ratio was not available and taking into account such other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a P/BV reference range of 0.66x to 1.67x. J.P. Morgan then applied this reference range to the Company's BVPS of $65.96, as of June 30, 2025 calculated pro forma for publicly announced cash contingent and possessed insurance settlement proceeds to recover losses relating to aircraft detained in Russia. This resulted in implied equity value of $43.55 to $110.15 (in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05) per share of Class A Common Stock, compared to the merger consideration of $65.00 per share of Class A Common Stock. The subsection titled \"Dividend Discount Analysis\" starting on page 65 of the Definitive Proxy Statement is amended by replacing the subsection in its entirety with the following (new text is underlined and bold): Dividend Discount Analysis J.P. Morgan conducted a dividend discount analysis to determine a range of equity values for the Class A Common Stock based on 114.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding provided by the Company's management, assuming the Company continued to operate as a standalone entity. The range was determined by adding the present value of an estimated future dividend stream for the Company over an eight-year period from 2025 through 2032, using the Air Lease Projections (as defined below) provided by the management of the Company (as discussed more fully in the section entitled \" Certain Projected Financial Information \" beginning on page 69 of this proxy statement) and the present value of an estimated terminal value of the shares of Class A Common Stock at the end of 2032. J.P. Morgan used the perpetuity growth method to calculate the range of terminal values based on a terminal value growth rate of 1.50% to 2.50% (among other terminal year assumptions) . The range of terminal values was then discounted to present values as of June 30, 2025 using a range of discount rates from 8.50% to 9.50%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis J.P. Morgan ' s estimate of the cost of equity of the Company , taking into account macroeconomic assumptions, estimates of risk, the Company ' s capital structure and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered to be appropriate in its experience and professional judgment . This analysis implied an equity value of $58.30 to $75.20 (in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05) per share of Class A Common Stock as of June 30, 2025, compared to the merger consideration of $65.00 per share of Class A Common Stock. The disclosure in the section titled \"The Merger Certain Projected Financial Information\" beginning on page 69 of the Definitive Proxy Statement, is hereby amended as follows: The Company, as a matter of course, does not publicly disclose long-term forecasts or internal projections as to future financial performance, earnings, or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the Air Lease Board's evaluation of the merger, the Company's management provided to J.P. Morgan and Parent certain unaudited prospective financial information relating to the Company on a standalone basis for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2025 through December 31, 2028, and extrapolations of certain forecasts for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2029 through December 31, 2032 (the \"Air Lease Projections\") , which we refer to as the Preliminary Projections (as defined below) and the Air Lease Projections (as defined below) . The Air Lease Projections were provided to J.P. Morgan by the Company for its use and reliance in connection with its financial analyses and opinion, as more fully described in the section entitled \" Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor\" beginning on page 60. 4 None of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed merger. Certain of these transactions may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the proposed merger. However, the selected transactions were chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan's analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed merger. Based on the results of this analysis , and after excluding the transactions for which the P/BV ratio was not available and taking into account such other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a P/BV reference range of 0.66x to 1.67x. J.P. Morgan then applied this reference range to the Company's BVPS of $65.96, as of June 30, 2025 calculated pro forma for publicly announced cash contingent and possessed insurance settlement proceeds to recover losses relating to aircraft detained in Russia. This resulted in implied equity value of $43.55 to $110.15 (in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05) per share of Class A Common Stock, compared to the merger consideration of $65.00 per share of Class A Common Stock. , after excluding the transactions for which the P/BV ratio was not available and taking into account such The subsection titled \"Dividend Discount Analysis\" starting on page 65 of the Definitive Proxy Statement is amended by replacing the subsection in its entirety with the following (new text is underlined and bold): Dividend Discount Analysis J.P. Morgan conducted a dividend discount analysis to determine a range of equity values for the Class A Common Stock based on 114.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding provided by the Company's management, assuming the Company continued to operate as a standalone entity. The range was determined by adding the present value of an estimated future dividend stream for the Company over an eight-year period from 2025 through 2032, using the Air Lease Projections (as defined below) provided by the management of the Company (as discussed more fully in the section entitled \" Certain Projected Financial Information \" beginning on page 69 of this proxy statement) and the present value of an estimated terminal value of the shares of Class A Common Stock at the end of 2032. J.P. Morgan used the perpetuity growth method to calculate the range of terminal values based on a terminal value growth rate of 1.50% to 2.50% (among other terminal year assumptions) . The range of terminal values was then discounted to present values as of June 30, 2025 using a range of discount rates from 8.50% to 9.50%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis J.P. Morgan ' s estimate of the cost of equity of the Company , taking into account macroeconomic assumptions, estimates of risk, the Company ' s capital structure and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered to be appropriate in its experience and professional judgment . 114.6 million Certain Projected Financial Information the range of terminal values based on (among other terminal year assumptions) an analysis J.P. Morgan ' s estimate taking into account macroeconomic assumptions, estimates of risk, the Company s capital structure and other factors that J.P.

Morgan in connection with the merger. The inclusion of the below information should not be regarded as an indication that any of the Company or its respective advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, to be necessarily predictive of actual future results, or that it should be construed as financial guidance, and such summary projections set forth below should not be relied on as such. This information was prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many respects. While presented with numerical specificity, the Preliminary Projections and the Air Lease Projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of the Company's management, including, among others, the factors described in the sections entitled \" Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information \" and \" Where You Can Find Additional Information .\" The Preliminary Projections and the Air Lease Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and subjective judgment that is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The Company can give no assurance that the Preliminary Projections and the Air Lease Projections and the underlying estimates and assumptions will be realized. In addition, since the Preliminary Projections and the Air Lease Projections cover multiple years, this information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.

The Purchase Agreement contained customary representations and warranties of the parties, including, among others, with respect to corporate authority. The Purchase Agreement also included indemnification provisions pursuant to which the Prior Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the New Sponsor and the Company for certain losses, damages, liabilities, and claims, including those arising from breaches of representations and warranties, claims by third parties, or any failure to deliver the acquired securities free and clear of liens or other encumbrances.

(NASDAQ:PROF; TSX:PRN) (\"Profound\" or the \"Company\"), a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and markets AI-powered, MRI-guided, incision-free therapies for the ablation of diseased tissue, announced today the upcoming launch of its TULSA-AI Volume Reduction module for optimizing the treatment of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (\"BPH\"), or enlarged prostate, at the Radiological Society of North America (\"RSNA\") meeting taking place in Chicago, Nov. 30-Dec. 4. BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland due to an overgrowth of prostate cells. It is a common condition as men age, often impeding the flow of urine and creating significant lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Current BPH treatment with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is largely unchanged over the past 100 years. Many alternative treatment methods have been investigated aiming to improve the patient experience and reduce the rates of complications such as bleeding, erectile dysfunction, loss of ejaculation, and the need to stay in the hospital overnight for one, two or more days. The TULSA ProcedureTM, performed using Profound's TULSA-PRO system, is the only incision-free procedure for prostate cancer, BPH, and patients who have both prostate cancer and BPH. With the TULSA-AI Volume Reduction module, physicians can efficiently and easily stack multiple prostate cases in one day, using the same device hardware, clinical support staff and reimbursement codes. The TULSA Procedure's clinical flexibility - along with real-world data demonstrating significantly reduced risk of loss of sexual function and incontinence, and CAPTAIN perioperative data demonstrating the TULSA Procedure's superiority to Robotic Prostatectomy in blood loss, length of stay, post-op pain and recovery time - is fueling strong demand for the incision-free procedure from both patients and healthcare providers. \"We're confident to launch the TULSA-AI Volume Reduction module for BPH, following a successful pilot trial earlier this year,\" said Profound CEO and Chairman, Arun Menawat. \"The use of AI to streamline the workflow and reduce procedure times is a significant advance that makes using TULSA-PRO for treating enlarged prostate just as efficient as other modern procedures, but with the advanced benefits of precision and customization to any prostate shape or size.

Presentation \"Randomized Controlled Trial evaluating MRI-Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation (TULSA) Versus Robotic Prostatectomy,\" Dr. Geoffrey Sonn from Stanford; Friday, Dec. 5 from 2:30-3:30 MST. About Profound Medical Corp. Profound is a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and markets AI-powered, MRI-guided, incision-free therapies for the ablation of diseased tissue. Profound is commercializing TULSA-PRO, a technology that combines real-time MRI, AI-enhanced planning, robotically-driven transurethral ultrasound and closed-loop temperature feedback control. The TULSA ProcedureTM , performed using the TULSA-PRO system, has the potential of becoming a mainstream treatment modality across the entire prostate disease spectrum; ranging from low-, intermediate-, or high-risk prostate cancer; to hybrid patients suffering from both prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (\"BPH\"); to men with BPH only; and also, to patients requiring salvage therapy for radio-recurrent localized prostate cancer. The TULSA Procedure employs real-time MR guidance for precision to preserve patients' urinary continence and sexual function, while killing the targeted prostate tissue via precise sound absorption technology that gently heats it to 55-57C. TULSA is an incision- and radiation-free \"one-and-done\" procedure performed in a single session that takes a few hours. Virtually all prostate shapes and sizes can be safely, effectively, and efficiently treated with TULSA. There is no bleeding associated with the procedure; no hospital stay is required; and most TULSA patients report quick recovery to their normal routine. TULSA-PRO is CE marked, Health Canada approved, and 510(k) cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). Profound is also commercializing Sonalleve , an innovative therapeutic platform that is CE marked for the treatment of uterine fibroids, adenomyosis, pain palliation of bone metastases, desmoid tumors and osteoid osteoma. Sonalleve has also been approved by the China National Medical Products Administration for the non-invasive treatment of uterine fibroids and has FDA approval under a Humanitarian Device Exemption for the treatment of osteoid osteoma. Profound is in the early stages of exploring additional potential treatment markets for Sonalleve where the technology has been shown to have clinical application, such as non-invasive ablation of abdominal cancers and hyperthermia for cancer therapy.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "positive", "score": 0.9977793097496033}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9991244673728943}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9562857151031494}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994462132453918}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9972105622291565}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.782965898513794}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9839420914649963}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981846213340759}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.998222291469574}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9971427321434021}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981880784034729}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9929991960525513}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9969576597213745}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999107301235199}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.998051643371582}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993902444839478}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9986177682876587}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993058443069458}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9955087900161743}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993828535079956}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992524981498718}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9991545677185059}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9990301132202148}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9970916509628296}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.994642972946167}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9843696355819702}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995463490486145}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9597553014755249}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9974128603935242}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.997818112373352}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9979931116104126}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9980358481407166}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9970734119415283}], "sentiment": "positive"}], "overall_sentiment": "positive", "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": null}, "000132581425000219": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1325814/000132581425000219/fhlbdm-20251124.htm", "filing_date": "Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:52:31 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": false, "ticker": null, "items": {}, "exhibits": [], "overall_sentiment": null, "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": "Missing ticker or items"}, "000162828025054260": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828025054260/rick-20251125.htm", "filing_date": "Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:50:47 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": true, "ticker": "RICK", "items": {"item 5.02": {"text": "On November 25, 2025, Eric Langan and Bradley Chhay notified RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc.

(the \"Company\") annual meeting of stockholders completed on August 18, 2025, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \"Amendment\") to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 to 1-for-30, with such ratio to be determined in the discretion of the Company's board of directors and with such reverse stock split to be effected at such time and date, if at all, as determined by the Company's board of directors in its sole discretion prior to the one-year anniversary of the annual meeting. Pursuant to such authority granted by the Company's stockholders, the Company's board of directors approved a one-for-twenty-five (1:25) reverse stock split (the \"Reverse Stock Split\") of the Company's common stock and the filing of the Amendment to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split. The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Reverse Stock Split will become effective in accordance with the terms of the Amendment at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on December 1, 2025 (the \"Effective Time\"), and the Company's common stock will open for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on December 1, 2025 on a post-split basis, under the existing ticker symbol \"MBRX\" but with a new CUSIP number 60855D408. The Amendment provides that, at the Effective Time, every twenty-five (25) shares of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock will automatically be combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share, which will remain $0.001. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of shares of common stock outstanding will be reduced from approximately 51.6 million shares to approximately 2.07 million shares, and the number of authorized shares of common stock will remain at 500 million shares. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, except as set forth below, proportionate adjustments will be made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all outstanding stock options, restricted stock unit awards and warrants, which will result in a proportional decrease in the number of shares of the Company's common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options, restricted stock unit awards and warrants, and, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportional increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and warrants. With respect to the Company's outstanding Series E Warrants to purchase 27,852,241 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.37 per share and Series F warrants to purchase 64,864,864 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.43 per share, if the lowest daily volume weighted average price during the period commencing five consecutive trading days immediately preceding and the five consecutive trading days commencing on the date of the Reverse Stock Split is less than the exercise price of the Series E warrants and/or Series F warrants then in effect, then the exercise price of such warrants will be reduced to the lowest daily volume weighted average price during such period. In addition, solely with respect to the Series E warrants, the number of shares issuable upon exercise will be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate price will remain unchanged, subject to a floor price of $3.00 per share. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Company's equity compensation plan immediately prior to the Effective Time will be reduced proportionately.

The reverse stock split will take effect at 12:01 am (Eastern Time) on December 1, 2025, and the Company's common stock will open for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on December 1, 2025 on a post-split basis, under the existing ticker symbol \"MBRX\" but with a new CUSIP number 60855D 408. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 25 shares of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding prior to the opening of trading on December 1, 2025 will be consolidated into one issued and outstanding share, with no change in the nominal par value per share of $0.001. No fractional shares will be issued if, as a result of the reverse stock split, a stockholder would become entitled to a fractional share because the number of shares of common stock they hold before the reverse stock split is not evenly divisible by the split ratio. Instead, the stockholder will be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu of a fractional share. As a result of the reverse stock split, the number of shares of common stock outstanding will be reduced from approximately 51.7 million shares to approximately 2.1 million shares, and the number of authorized shares of common stock will remain at 500 million shares. About Moleculin Biotech, Inc. Moleculin Biotech, Inc. is a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company advancing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates addressing hard-to-treat tumors and viruses. The Company's lead program, Annamycin, is a next-generation highly efficacious and well tolerated anthracycline designed to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms and to lack the cardiotoxicity common with currently prescribed anthracyclines. Annamycin is currently in development for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) lung metastases. The Company has begun the MIRACLE ( olecul /R AML nnAraC inical valuation) Trial (MB-108), a pivotal, adaptive design Phase 3 trial evaluating Annamycin in combination with cytarabine, together referred to as AnnAraC (the combination of Annamycin and cytarabine, also referred to as \"Ara-C\") and, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Following a successful Phase 1B/2 study (MB-106), with input from the FDA, the Company believes it has substantially de-risked the development pathway towards a potential approval for Annamycin for the treatment of AML. This study remains subject to appropriate future filings with potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents. Additionally, the Company is developing WP1066, an Immune/Transcription Modulator capable of inhibiting p-STAT3 and other oncogenic transcription factors while also stimulating a natural immune response, targeting brain tumors, pancreatic and other cancers. Moleculin also has in its pipeline a portfolio of antimetabolites, including WP1122 for the potential treatment of pathogenic viruses, as well as certain cancer indications.

Larson's departure is not the result of any disagreements with the Company on any matter relating to its financial statements, internal control over financial reporting, operations, policies or practices. About Beyond Air , Inc. Beyond Air is a commercial-stage medical device and biopharmaceutical company dedicated to harnessing the power of endogenous and exogenous nitric oxide (NO) to improve the lives of patients suffering from respiratory illnesses, neurological disorders, and solid tumors. The Company has received FDA approval and CE Mark for its first system, LungFit PH, for the treatment of term and near-term neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure. Beyond Air is currently advancing its other revolutionary LungFit systems in clinical trials for the treatment of severe lung infections such as viral community-acquired pneumonia (including COVID-19) and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Company has also partnered with The Hebrew University of Jerusalem to advance a pre-clinical program dedicated to the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurological disorders. Additionally, Beyond Cancer, Ltd., an affiliate of Beyond Air, is investigating ultra-high concentrations of NO with a proprietary delivery system to target certain solid tumors in the pre-clinical setting. For more information, visit www.beyondair.net About LungFit * Beyond Air's LungFit is a cylinder-free, phasic flow generator and delivery system designated as a medical device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The ventilator-compatible version of the device can generate NO from ambient air on demand for delivery to the lungs at concentrations ranging from 1 ppm to 80 ppm. The LungFit system could potentially replace large, high-pressure NO cylinders, providing significant advantages in the hospital setting, including greatly reducing inventory and storage requirements, improving overall safety by eliminating NO2 purging steps, and offering other operational benefits. LungFit can also deliver NO at concentrations at or above 80 ppm for potentially treating severe acute lung infections in the hospital setting (e.g., COVID-19, bronchiolitis) and chronic, refractory lung infections in the home setting (e.g., NTM). With the elimination of cylinders, Beyond Air intends to offer NO treatment in the home setting. *Beyond Air's LungFit PH is approved for commercial use in the United States, European Union, and many other countries around the world. Beyond Air's other LungFit systems are not approved for commercial use and are for investigational use only. Beyond Air is not suggesting NO use over 80 ppm or use at home. About Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a lethal condition and secondary to failure of normal circulatory transition at birth. It is a syndrome characterized by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that causes labile hypoxemia due to decreased pulmonary blood flow and right-to-left shunting of blood. Its incidence has been reported as 1.9 per 1,000 live births (0.46.8/1000 live births) with mortality rate ranging between 433%. This syndrome complicates the course of about 10% of infants with respiratory failure and remains a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. NO gas is a vasodilator, is approved in dozens of countries to improve oxygenation and reduces the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in term and near-term (>34 weeks gestation) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension in conjunction with ventilator support and other appropriate agents. About Beyond Cancer, Ltd. Beyond Cancer, Ltd., an affiliate of Beyond Air, Inc., is a development-stage biopharmaceutical and medical device company utilizing (UNO via a proprietary delivery platform to treat primary tumors and prevent metastatic disease. Nitric oxide at ultra-high concentrations has been reported to show anticancer properties and to potentially serve as a chemosensitizer and radiotherapy enhancer. A first-in-human study is underway in subjects with solid tumors. The Company is conducting preclinical studies of UNO in multiple solid tumor models to inform additional treatment protocols. For more information, visit www.beyondcancer.com About NeuroNOS NeuroNOS is at the forefront of developing innovative treatments for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The company specializes in creating therapies based on small molecules that cross the blood-brain barrier to regulate Nitric Oxide (NO) levels in the brain. Preclinical studies conducted by NeuroNOS have demonstrated that NO is present at elevated levels in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and adults suffering from brain-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and brain cancers. The company's research has shown that managing NO levels in the brain is crucial for maintaining normal brain function.

On November 28, 2025, Flora Growth Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of the Province of Ontario (the \"Company\", \"our\"), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") and a Registration Rights Agreement (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\") with White Lion Capital, LLC (the \"Investor\"), pursuant to which the Investor has committed to purchase, subject to certain limitations, up to $25 million (the \"Initial Commitment\") of the Company's common shares, no par value (the \"Common Shares\"), which Initial Commitment may be increased to up to an aggregate of $50 million Common Shares at the discretion of the Company upon a written notice to the Investor (the \"Total Commitment\"). Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to direct the Investor to purchase up to the Total Commitment of Common Shares from time to time for a period of 24 months from the date of the Purchase Agreement. The purchase is subject to certain conditions, including the filing and effectiveness of a resale registration statement (the \"Registration Statement\") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") registering the resale of the shares to be sold to the Investor under the Purchase Agreement. Upon receipt of a purchase notice from the Company, the Investor may be obligated to purchase Common Shares as the Company directs, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The Company can provide two kinds of notices - a regular purchase notice and a rapid purchase notice. The Common Shares will be purchased by the Investor according to the kind of notice provided. For: a regular purchase notice, 97% of the lowest daily VWAP of the Common Shares for the two consecutive business days commencing on and including the day the regular purchase notice is delivered; or a rapid purchase notice, either (i) the lowest traded price of the Common Shares on the date the rapid purchase notice is delivered or (ii) 97% of the lowest traded price of the Shares two hours following the written confirmation of the acceptance of the rapid purchase notice by the Investor. As such, the actual number of Common Shares purchased by the Investor under the Purchase Agreement will vary depending on the then-current market price of our Common Shares sold to the Investor under the Purchase Agreement, but will not exceed the number set forth above unless we file an additional registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), with the SEC. Actual sales of Common Shares, if any, to the Investor will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time-to-time, including, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the Company's Common Shares, and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations. The net proceeds from sales, if any, under the Purchase Agreement to the Company will depend on the frequency and prices at which the Company sells Common Shares to the Investor. The Company expects that any proceeds received by the Company from such sales to the Investor will primarily be used to advance the Company's digital asset treasury strategy with a focus on the $0G token and for general corporate purposes. It is possible that no shares will be issued under the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company will pay commitment fee to the Investor in the form of Common Shares with an aggregate market value of $125,000 or 0.5% of the Initial Commitment (the \"Initial Commitment Fee\"), which will be paid on the effective date of the Registration Statement (each a \"Commitment Fee Payment Date\"). If the Initial Commitment is increased, the Company will pay an additional commitment fee to the Investor in the form of Common Shares with an aggregate market value equal to 0.5% of such increased commitment amount. In connection with the entry into the Purchase Agreement, the Company also entered into the Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to file with the SEC, within twenty business days of the execution date of the Purchase Agreement, the Registration Statement for the resale by the Investor of the Common Shares that may be issued in connection with the Initial Commitment under the Purchase Agreement (including the Common Shares used to pay the Initial Commitment Fee, if any). The Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, conditions, and indemnification obligations of the parties.
