Such interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The Company's board of directors (\"Board\") was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Agreement approving the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Acquisition, and in making their recommendation that TZUP stockholders approve and adopt the Agreement. This supplement to the Interests of TZUP Executive Officers and Directors in the Acquisition (i) modifies the previously reported interests in the Acquisition with respect to the Company's officers and/or directors, Robert Haag, Isaac Dietrich, Joanna Massey, and Paul Dickman and (ii) describes additional interests in the Acquisition with respect to Christopher Ensey, who was appointed as a member of the Board effective as of October 14, 2025, to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Robert Haag. modifies the previously reported interests in the Acquisition with respect to the Company's officers and/or directors, Robert Haag, Isaac Dietrich, Joanna Massey, and Paul Dickman and (ii) as a member of the Board effective as of October 14, 2025, to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Robert Haag.

As a result of the Rescissions, (i) all of the August RSAs are void ab initio, and the recipients and the Company are restored to the same positions as though the grant of the August RSAs had never occurred; (ii) the August RSAs no longer represent a potential conflict of interest of the above executives and directors, with respect to the stockholders' interests in the approval of the Acquisition; and (iii) the Previous RSA Table and the values of the August RSAs as reported on the Previous RSA Table need not be considered in evaluating any such potential conflicts of interests of executives or directors with respect to the stockholders' interests in the Acquisition, and should be disregarded.

Board of Directors Thumzup Media Corporation 10557 Jefferson Blvd Suite B Culver City, CA 90232 November 24, 2025 Re: Supplemental Letter Regarding Fairness Opinion in Connection with the Proposed Merger of Thumzup Media Corporation and Dogehash Technologies, Inc. Members of the Board: Reference is made to our opinion dated October 3, 2025 (the \"Opinion\") delivered to the Board of Directors of Thumzup Media Corporation (\"Thumzup\" or the \"Company\") in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated August 18, 2025 (the \"Merger Agreement\") among the Company, Dogehash Technologies, Inc. (\"Dogehash\") and TZUP Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (\"Merger Sub\").\" Pursuant to the Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement), Merger Sub will be merged with and into Dogehash, with Dogehash continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the shareholders of Dogehash will receive an aggregate of 30,700,000 restricted shares of Thumzup common stock (the \"Merger Consideration\") in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of Dogehash. In the Opinion, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, we stated that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to such matters, the Merger Consideration to be issued by Thumzup pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Thumzup common stock (other than Dogehash and its affiliates), in their capacity as such holders. We have been advised that the Merger Agreement has been or will be amended such that (i) certain outstanding indebtedness of Dogehash that was previously expected to be satisfied through the issuance of a portion of the Merger Consideration will instead have its principal amount repaid in cash at closing, (ii) only the accrued and unpaid interest on such indebtedness will be paid in shares of Thumzup common stock, and (iii) as a result, the aggregate number of restricted shares of Thumzup common stock to be issued as Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger will be reduced from 30,700,000 restricted shares to 30,075,000 restricted shares (the \"Revised Merger Consideration\"). At the request of the Board, we have considered the effect of the Revised Merger Consideration on the Opinion. In doing so, we have, among other things, reviewed information you have provided to us regarding the changes to the form and amount of the Merger Consideration described above. We have not otherwise updated the analyses underlying our Opinion, and we express no view as to any developments in the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of Thumzup or Dogehash, or in the financial or capital markets generally, after October 3, 2025, except to the limited extent expressly described in this letter. Based upon and subject to the foregoing and to the other assumptions, qualifications, limitations and matters set forth in the Opinion, and in light of the Revised Merger Consideration, we confirm that the changes to the form and amount of the Merger Consideration described above would not have altered the conclusion stated in our Opinion. Specifically, if we were required to render the Opinion again as of October 3, 2025, taking into account the Revised Merger Consideration, we would reach the same conclusion as set forth in the Opinion; namely, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the matters described therein, the Merger Consideration to be issued by Thumzup in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Thumzup common stock (other than Dogehash and its affiliates), in their capacity as such holders. This letter should be read in conjunction with, and is subject in all respects to, the Opinion. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this letter have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. This letter is furnished solely for the information of, and assistance to, the Board of Directors of Thumzup in connection with its evaluation of the amendment to the Merger Agreement and may not be used, quoted, referred to or relied upon by any other person without our prior written consent, except that this letter may be described in, and a copy may be attached to, the Company's proxy statement, proxy supplement and/or Current Report on Form 8-K relating to the Merger, in each case in accordance with applicable securities laws. Our confirmation in this letter speaks only as of the date hereof, and we assume no responsibility to update or revise it based on circumstances or events occurring after the date hereof.

(the \"Company\") received a letter (the \"Notice\") from the Listing Qualifications Department (the \"Staff\") of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") that stated the Staff's belief that the Company is a \"public shell\" and that, therefore, the continued listing of its securities is no longer warranted in the view of the Staff. In the Notice, the Staff explained that it based this belief on its review of the Company's public disclosures and materials submitted to the Staff by the Company. In addition, the Staff noted its belief is supported by the Company's lack of revenue generating assets and the substantial reduction in employees and operations since February 2024. The Staff also considered the Company's quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q filed on May 8, 2025, August 7, 2025, and November 13, 2025, respectively, which indicated that the Company has not generated any revenue for the nine months ended 2025 and that the Company had research and development expenses of only $16,000. The Notice further advised that, unless the Company timely requests a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the \"Panel\"), it would be subject to suspension/delisting.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Impairment Assessment for Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets As described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's other intangible assets balance includes $165.3 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2024. For intangible assets not subject to amortization, management evaluates for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The determination of fair value is based on the relief from royalty method of the income approach, which incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow analysis. Management's discounted cash flow analysis includes assumptions related to forecasted future revenues, royalty rates and discount rates. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the indefinite-lived intangible assets; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumption related to the discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate for the indefinite-lived intangible assets; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the relief from royalty method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the relief from royalty method and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumption used by management related to the discount rate. Evaluating management's assumption related to the discount rate involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was reasonable considering whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company's relief from royalty method and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New York, New York February 20, 2025 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1952.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Description The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company,\" \"IPG,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") is one of the world's premier global advertising and marketing services companies. Our agencies create customized marketing programs for clients that range in scale from large global marketers to regional and local clients. Comprehensive global services are critical to effectively serve our multinational and local clients in markets throughout the world, as they seek to build brands, increase sales of their products and services and gain market share. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, some of which are not wholly owned. Investments in companies over which we do not have control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in companies over which we have neither control nor have the ability to exercise significant influence are recorded at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We have consolidated certain entities meeting the definition of variable interest entities, and the inclusion of these entities does not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation We conduct our business across three reportable segments described in Note 16. The three reportable segments are: Media, Data & Engagement Solutions (\"MD&E\"), Integrated Advertising & Creativity Led Solutions (\"IA&C\"), and Specialized Communications & Experiential Solutions (\"SC&E\"). Cost of services is comprised of the expenses of our revenue-producing operating segments including salaries and related expenses, office and other direct expenses and billable expenses, as well as an allocation of the centrally managed expenses from Corporate and other. Office and other direct expenses include rent expense, professional fees, certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and other costs directly attributable to client engagements. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily the unallocated expenses from Corporate and other excluding depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of the fixed assets and intangible assets of the Company is disclosed as a separate operating expense. Impairment of goodwill is disclosed as a separate operating expense. Restructuring charges in 2024 consist of adjustments to the Company's restructuring actions taken in 2022 and 2020, and primarily relate to real estate actions which were designed to reduce our real estate footprint and to better align our cost structure with revenue. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications and immaterial adjustments have been made to prior-period financial statements to conform to the current-period presentation, including the recast of certain prior period adjustments to reflect the transfer of certain agencies between reportable segments. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A further decline in macroeconomic conditions or increasing interest rates could have a negative impact on these estimates, including the fair value of certain estimates. Revenue Recognition Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multi-channel advertising and communications, marketing services, including public relations, meeting and event production, sports and entertainment marketing, corporate and brand identity, strategic marketing consulting, and providing marketing data and technology services around the world. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn fees and commissions vary significantly. Our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 30 to 90 days, although our data management contracts typically have non-cancelable terms of more than one year. Our payment terms vary by client, and the time between invoicing date and due date is typically not significant. We generally have the legally enforceable right to payment for all services provided through the end of the contract or termination date. We recognize revenue when we determine our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue as or when we satisfy the performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that IPG will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are distinct performance obligations. We then assess whether we act as an agent or a principal for each identified performance obligation and include revenue within the transaction price for third-party costs when we determine that we act as principal. We typically do not capitalize costs to obtain a contract as these amounts would generally be recognized over a period of one year or less. Revenue before billable expenses, primarily consisting of fees, commissions and performance incentives, represents the amount of our gross billings excluding billable expenses charged to a client. Generally, our compensation is based on a negotiated fixed price, rate per hour, a retainer, commission or volume. The majority of our fees are recognized over time as services are performed, either utilizing a function of hours incurred and rates per hour, as compared to periodically updated estimates to complete, or ratably over the term of the contract. For certain less-frequent commission-based contracts which contain clauses allowing our clients to terminate the arrangement at any time for no compensation, revenue is recognized at a point in time, typically the date of broadcast or publication. We report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to mutually agreed-upon qualitative and/or quantitative metrics. Performance incentives are treated as variable consideration which is estimated at contract inception and included in revenue based on the most likely amount earned out of a range of potential outcomes. Our estimates are based on a combination of historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment. These estimates are updated on a periodic basis and are not expected to result in a reversal of a significant amount of the cumulative revenue recognized. The predominant component of billable expenses are third-party vendor costs incurred for performance obligations where we have determined that we are acting as principal. These third-party expenses are generally billed back to our clients. Billable expenses also includes incidental costs incurred in the performance of our services including airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out-of-town meals and telecommunication charges. We record these billable expenses within total revenue with a corresponding offset to operating expenses. In international markets, we may receive rebates or credits from vendors based on transactions entered into on behalf of clients. Rebates and credits are remitted back to our clients in accordance with our contractual requirements or may be retained by us based on the terms of a particular client contract and local law. Amounts owed back to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned. In certain international markets, our media contracts may allow clients to terminate our arrangement at any time for no compensation to the extent that media has not yet run. For those contracts, we do not recognize revenue until the media runs which is the point in time at which we have a legally enforceable right to compensation. In the normal course of business, certain agencies may enter into agreements with media suppliers to purchase an agreed value of media within a fixed timeframe. By entering into these agreements, the agency is taking a risk and may be required to pay a portion or all of the agreed value ahead of media being run. In order to participate in these arrangements and receive an agreed additional benefit from the agency, clients are required to contractually opt in. Performance Obligations Our client contracts may include various goods and services that are capable of being distinct, are distinct within the context of the contract and are therefore accounted for as separate performance obligations. We allocate revenue to each performance obligation in the contract at inception based on its relative standalone selling price. Our advertising businesses include a wide range of services that involve the creation of an advertising idea, concept, campaign, or marketing strategy in order to promote the client's brand (\"creative services\"), and to act as an agent to facilitate the production of advertisements by third-party suppliers (\"production services\"). Our clients can contract us to perform one or both of these services, as they can derive stand-alone benefit from each. Production services can include formatting creative material for different media and communication mediums including digital, large-scale reproduction such as printing and adaptation services, talent engagement and acquisition, television and radio production, and outdoor billboard production. Our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the creative advertising services and those that constitute the production services. Both the creative and production services are sold separately, the client can derive utility from each service on its own, we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle, the services do not significantly modify one another, and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent. As such, we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our advertising contracts. Our media businesses include services to formulate strategic media plans (\"media planning services\") and to act as an agent to purchase media (e.g. television and radio spots, outdoor advertising, digital banners, etc.) from vendors on our clients' behalf (\"media buying services\"). Our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the planning services and those that constitute the buying services. Both the planning and buying services are sold separately, the client can derive utility from each service on its own, we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle, the services do not significantly modify one another, and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent. As such, we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our media contracts. Our events businesses include creative services related to the conception and planning of custom marketing events as well as activation services which entail the carrying out of the event, including, but not limited to, set-up, design and staffing. Additionally, our public relations businesses include a broad range of services, such as strategic planning, social media strategy and the monitoring and development of communication strategies, among others. While our contracts in these businesses may include some or all of these services, we typically identify only one performance obligation in the assessment of our events and public relations contracts as we provide a significant service of integrating the individual services into a combined service for which the customer has contracted. Our data and technology services businesses include data management, data and data strategy, identity resolution, and measurement and analytics products and services. While our contracts in these businesses may include some or all of these services, we typically identify each product and service as an individual performance obligation. We have elected not to disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. The majority of our contracts are for periods of one year or less with the exception of our data management contracts. Principal vs. Agent When a third-party is involved in the delivery of our services to the client, we assess whether or not we are acting as a principal or an agent in the arrangement. The assessment is based on whether we control the specified services at any time before they are transferred to the customer. We have determined that in our events and public relations businesses, we generally act as a principal as our agencies provide a significant service of integrating goods or services provided by third parties into the specified deliverable to our clients. In addition, we have determined that we are responsible for the performance of the third-party suppliers, which are combined with our own services, before transferring those services to the customer. We have also determined that we act as principal when providing creative services and media planning services, as we perform a significant integration service in these transactions. For performance obligations in which we act as principal, we record the gross amount billed to the customer within total revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as billable expenses. In the vast majority of our business, when a third-party is involved in the production of an advertising campaign and for media buying services, we have determined that we act as the agent and are solely arranging for the third-party suppliers to provide services to the customer. Specifically, we do not control the specified services before transferring those services to the customer, we are not primarily responsible for the performance of the third-party services, nor can we redirect those services to fulfill any other contracts. We do not have inventory risk or discretion in establishing pricing in our contracts with customers. For performance obligations for which we act as the agent, we record our revenue as the net amount of our gross billings less amounts remitted to third parties. Cash and Cash Equivalents equivalents are highly liquid investments, which include certificates of deposit, government securities, commercial paper and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and are stated at estimated fair value, which approximates cost. Cash is maintained at multiple high-credit-quality financial institutions. Allowance for Expected Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses on expected future uncollectible accounts receivable is estimated based on the aging of accounts receivable, reviews of client credit reports, industry trends and economic indicators, as well as reviews of recent payment history for specific customers. The estimate is based largely on a formula-driven calculation but is supplemented with economic indicators and knowledge of potential write-offs of specific client accounts. Accounts Receivable, Billable to Clients Accounts receivable, billable to clients are primarily comprised of production and media costs that have been incurred but have not yet been billed to clients, as well as fees that have been earned which have not yet been billed to clients. Unbilled amounts are presented in accounts receivable, billable to clients regardless of whether they relate to our fees or production and media costs. A provision is made for unrecoverable costs as deemed appropriate. Accounts Payable Accounts payable includes all operating payables, including those related to all media and production costs. These payables are due within one year. Investments Equity investments with readily determinable fair values, other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting, will be measured at fair value. We regularly review our investments to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may impact the fair value of each investment, with changes to fair value recorded in earnings. We evaluate fair value based on specific information (valuation methodologies, estimates of appraisals, financial statements, etc.) in addition to quoted market price, if available. We consider all known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if a decline in value of an investment has occurred. Derivatives We are exposed to market risk related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. From time to time we enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes, and not for speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on our balance sheet. Changes in fair value are immediately included in earnings if the derivatives are not designated as a hedge instrument or if the derivatives do not qualify as effective hedges. For derivatives designated as hedge instruments, we evaluate for hedge accounting both at inception and throughout the hedge period. If a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, then changes in the fair value of the derivative are offset against the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, then the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to earnings in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in the same period as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. If a derivative is a net investment hedge, then the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other comprehensive income in the same period as the change in fair value of the underlying hedged foreign investment. Property and Equipment Furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements and buildings are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Furniture and equipment are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 3 to 7 years for furniture and equipment, 10 to 35 years for buildings and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for leasehold improvements. Land is stated at cost and is not depreciated. We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to our enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") systems. Our ERP systems are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are amortized using the straight-line method over 10 years. All other internal use computer software are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 3 to 7 years. Leases As of December 31, 2024, we do not have a material amount of finance leases and the majority of our operating leases, for which we serve as the lessee, consist primarily of real-estate property for our offices around the world. Both the right-of-use asset and lease liability are measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with the asset being subject to adjustments such as initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments, and lease incentives. Many of our leases provide for renewal and/or termination options, as well as escalation clauses, which are also factored into our lease payments when appropriate. The discount rate used to measure the lease asset and liability is determined at the beginning of the lease term using the rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable, or using the Company's collateralized credit-adjusted borrowing rate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets, as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. We review goodwill as of October 1st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 10 reporting units that were subject to the 2024 annual impairment testing. Our annual impairment review as of October 1, 2024 did not result in an impairment charge for any of our reporting units. Additionally, we performed an interim impairment test as of August 31, 2024. Refer to Note 9 for details. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The determination of fair value is based on the relief from royalty method of the income approach, which models the cash flows from indefinite-lived intangibles assuming royalties were received under a licensing arrangement. This discounted cash flow analysis includes assumptions related to forecasted future revenues attributable to indefinite-lived intangibles, royalty rates and risk-adjusted discount rates. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired, and an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Based on this analysis, for the indefinite lived-intangible asset for which we performed a quantitative impairment test as of October 1, 2024, we concluded that it was not impaired because its fair value was in excess of its carrying value. For reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment, or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as \"more likely than not\" that the fair value is less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is performed. For our annual impairment test, we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units' equity to the carrying value of their net assets. The sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is also reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the quantitative impairment test is failed and impaired goodwill is written down to its fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. fair value of each reporting unit for 2024 and 2023 was estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. These asset groups are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value. Impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 10 and 15 years. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations. Foreign Currencies The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders' equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. Foreign currency transactions resulted in a pre-tax loss of $2.2 for the year ended December 31, 2024, a pre-tax loss of $5.7 for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a pre-tax gain of $2.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022. monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. A currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. If this occurs the functional currency of that country is changed to our reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses are recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is \"more likely than not\" that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate our tax positions using the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold. The factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence, such as past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. We have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require. Redeemable Non-controlling Interests Many of our acquisitions include provisions under which the non-controlling equity owners can require us to purchase additional interests in a subsidiary at their discretion. Payments for these redeemable non-controlling interests may be contingent on projected operating performance and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements. These payments are also subject to revision in accordance with the terms of the agreements. We record these redeemable non-controlling interests in \"mezzanine equity\" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Each reporting period, redeemable non-controlling interests are reported at their estimated redemption value, but not less than their initial fair value. Any adjustment to the redemption value above initial value prior to exercise will also impact retained earnings but will not impact net income. Adjustments as a result of currency translation will affect the redeemable non-controlling interest balance, but do not impact retained earnings or additional paid-in capital. Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\") Basic EPS available to IPG common stockholders equals net income available to IPG common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted EPS equals net income available to IPG common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus any additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive shares had been issued. Diluted EPS reflect the potential dilution that would occur if certain potentially dilutive securities were exercised. The potential issuance of common stock is assumed to occur at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance of the potentially dilutive instrument, if later) and the incremental shares are included using the treasury stock method. The proceeds utilized in applying the treasury stock method consist of the amount, if any, to be paid upon exercise and, as it relates to stock-based compensation, the amount of compensation cost attributed to future service not yet recognized. These proceeds are then assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price of our stock during the period. The incremental shares (difference between the shares assumed to be issued and the shares assumed to be purchased), to the extent they would have been dilutive, are included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation. We may be required to calculate basic EPS using the two-class method as a result of our redeemable non-controlling interests. To the extent that the redemption value increases and exceeds the then-current fair value of a redeemable non-controlling interest, net income available to IPG common stockholders (used to calculate EPS) could be negatively impacted by that increase, subject to certain limitations. The partial or full recovery of any reductions to net income available to IPG common stockholders (used to calculate EPS) is limited to any cumulative prior-period reductions. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there was no impact to EPS for adjustments related to our redeemable non-controlling interests. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We have pension and postretirement benefit plans covering certain domestic and international employees. We use various actuarial methods and assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations, including the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefits, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The overfunded or underfunded status of our pension and postretirement benefit plans is recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation costs related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements based on fair value. Stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures. Treasury Stock We account for repurchased common stock under the cost method and include such treasury stock as a component of our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Upon retirement, we reduce common stock for the par value of the shares being retired and the excess of the cost of the shares over par value as a reduction to APIC, to the extent there is APIC in the same class of stock, and any remaining amount to retained earnings. These retired shares remain authorized but unissued. In October 2024, we retired 11.6 shares of our treasury stock, which resulted in a reduction in common stock of $1.2, treasury stock of $364.5 and APIC of $363.4. In October 2023, we retired 9.3 shares of our treasury stock, which resulted in a reduction in common stock of $0.9, treasury stock of $340.4 and APIC of $339.5. In October 2022, we retired $7.2 shares of our treasury stock, which resulted in a reduction in common stock of $0.7, treasury stock of $199.9 and APIC of $199.2. Note 2: Planned Acquisition of IPG by Omnicom On December 8, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Omnicom Group Inc. (\"Omnicom\") and EXT Subsidiary Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom (\"Merger Sub\"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into IPG, with IPG surviving the merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom. As a result of the merger, each share of IPG common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than certain excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.344 shares of Omnicom common stock and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares. The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to closing the merger. Following the close of the transaction, Omnicom shareholders will own 60.6% of the combined company and IPG shareholders will own 39.4%, on a fully diluted basis. As a result of the merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants. The stock-for-stock transaction is expected to be tax-free to IPG shareholders and is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to Omnicom and IPG shareholder approvals, required domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if Omnicom terminates the agreement (i) following a change or withdrawal of the recommendation of the IPG's board of directors to IPG stockholders to approve the merger, or (ii) as a result of a willful and material breach of our non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, then we will be obligated to pay a termination fee of $439.0 to Omnicom (the \"IPG Termination Fee\"). We will also be obligated to pay the IPG Termination Fee if (i) the IPG shareholders fail to approve the merger (and Omnicom has obtained shareholder approval), or (ii) we breach the Merger Agreement in a manner that Omnicom's closing conditions not being satisfied and the breach cannot be cured by the specified outside date and, in any such case, within 12 months after the termination date a competing proposal to acquire 50% or more of the business, assets or outstanding shares of IPG has been publicly announced and consummated, or a definitive agreement in respect of such competing proposal has been signed. We will also be required to reimburse up to $25.0 of Omnicom's merger-related fees, costs and expenses if the Merger Agreement is terminated as a result of the failure of the IPG shareholders to approve the merger (and Omnicom has obtained shareholder approval). During the fourth quarter of 2024, $9.3 of deal costs were incurred related to the planned acquisition of IPG by Omnicom, which were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.

December 31, December 31, Accounts receivable, net of allowance of $37.0 and $46.4, respectively 5,649.7 5,768.8 Accounts receivable, billable to clients 2,088.4 2,229.2 Contract assets Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) 509.0 684.7 Contract assets are primarily comprised of contract incentives that are generally satisfied annually under the terms of our contracts and are transferred to accounts receivable when the right to payment becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities relate to advance consideration received from customers under the terms of our contracts primarily related to reimbursements of third-party expenses, whether we act as principal or agent, and to a lesser extent, periodic retainer fees, both of which are generally recognized shortly after billing. The majority of our contracts are for periods of one year or less with the exception of our data management contracts. For those contracts with a term of more than one year, we had approximately $598.5 of unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2024, which will be recognized as services are performed over the remaining contractual terms through 2030. Note 4: Leases As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our operating leases, for which we serve as the lessee, consist primarily of real-estate property for our offices around the world, and we do not have a material amount of finance leases. Both the right-of-use asset and lease liability are measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with the asset being subject to adjustments such as initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments, and lease incentives. Many of our leases provide for renewal and/or termination options, as well as escalation clauses, which are also factored into our lease payments when appropriate. As of December 31, 2024, our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 12 years. The discount rate used to measure the lease asset and liability is determined at the beginning of the lease term using the rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable, or using the Company's collateralized credit-adjusted borrowing rate. The following tables present information on our operating leases for the full years of 2024, 2023 and 2022 Years ended December 31, Operating lease cost 266.1 268.4 290.7 Short-term lease cost Sublease income (30.1 (26.4 (23.8 Total lease cost 241.4 249.9 273.3 Cash paid related to operating lease liabilities 302.6 299.5 320.9 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities 109.4 As of December 31, Weighted-average remaining lease term Seven years Seven years Eight years Weighted-average discount rate Our future payments of our operating leases as of December 31, 2024 are listed in the table below.

Note 5: Debt and Credit Arrangements Long-Term Debt summary of the carrying amounts of our long-term debt is listed below. Effective Interest December 31, 4.200% Senior Notes due 2024 4.240 249.9 4.650% Senior Notes due 2028 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $0.7 and $1.7, respectively) 4.780 497.6 497.0 4.750% Senior Notes due 2030 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $2.2 and $3.2, respectively) 4.920 644.6 643.6 2.400% Senior Notes due 2031 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $0.5 and $2.9, respectively) 2.512 496.6 496.0 5.375% Senior Notes due 2033 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $3.3 and $2.7, respectively) 5.650 294.0 293.4 3.375% Senior Notes due 2041 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $0.9 and $4.7, respectively) 3.448 494.4 494.1 5.400% Senior Notes due 2048 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $2.5 and $4.4, respectively) 5.480 493.1 492.8 Other notes payable and capitalized leases Total long-term debt 2,920.6 3,167.6 Less: current portion 250.1 Long-term debt, excluding current portion 2,920.5 2,917.5 See Note 14 for information on the fair value measurement of our long-term debt. Annual maturities are scheduled as follows based on the book value as of December 31, 2024. 497.7 Thereafter 2,422.6 Total long-term debt 2,920.6 For those debt securities that have a premium or discount at the time of issuance, we amortize the amount through interest expense based on the maturity date or the first date the holders may require us to repurchase the debt securities, if applicable. A premium would result in a decrease in interest expense, and a discount would result in an increase in interest expense in future periods. Additionally, we have debt issuance costs related to certain financing transactions which are also amortized through interest expense. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had total unamortized debt issuance costs of $23.7 and $22.7, respectively. Our debt securities include covenants that, among other things, limit our liens and the liens of certain of our consolidated subsidiaries, but do not require us to maintain any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt was $2,702.0 and $2,975.3, respectively. Refer to Note 14 for details. Debt Transactions 4.200% Senior Notes due 2024 Our 4.200% unsecured senior notes in aggregate principal amount of $250.0 matured on April 15, 2024. We used cash on hand to fund the principal repayment. Credit Arrangement We maintain a committed corporate credit facility, originally dated as of July 18, 2008, which has been amended and restated from time to time (the \"Credit Agreement\"). We use our Credit Agreement to increase our financial flexibility, to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries and to support our commercial paper program. On May 29, 2024, we amended and restated the Credit Agreement. As amended, among other things, the maturity date of the Credit Agreement was extended to May 29, 2029 and the cost structure of the Credit Agreement was changed. The Credit Agreement continues to include a required leverage ratio, of not more than 3.50 to 1.00, among other customary covenants like limitations on our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary debt. At the election of the Company, the leverage ratio may be changed to not more than 4.00 to 1.00 for four consecutive quarters, beginning with the fiscal quarter in which there is an occurrence of one or more acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of at least $200.0. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $1,500.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. The Company has the ability to increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to $250.0, provided the Company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of $50.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement; however, we had $9.3 and $9.5 of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, which reduced our total availability to $1,490.7 and $1,490.5, respectively. In addition to other customary covenants, we are required to maintain the financial covenant listed below as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended pursuant to our Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with all of our covenants in the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024. Under the Credit Agreement, we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2024, the applicable margin was 0.125% for Base Rate advances and 1.125% for Eurocurrency Rate borrowings. Letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding, at a rate equal to the applicable margin for Eurocurrency rate advances, and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 0.250%. We also pay a facility fee on each lender's revolving commitment of 0.125%, which is an annual rate determined based on our credit ratings. Financial Covenant Leverage ratio (not greater than): 3.50x The leverage ratio is defined as debt as of the last day of such fiscal quarter to EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, for the four quarters then ended. Uncommitted Lines of Credit We also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates and that are primarily used to fund working capital needs. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit in an aggregate amount of $769.1 and $780.7, under which we had outstanding borrowings of $40.5 and $34.2 classified as short-term borrowings on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. The average amounts outstanding during 2024 and 2023 were $44.0 and $47.9, respectively, with weighted-average interest rates of approximately 7.6% and 7.9%, respectively. Commercial Paper The Company is authorized to issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1,500.0. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by the Credit Agreement described above. Commercial paper proceeds are used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness and other short-term liquidity needs. Commercial paper maturities vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no commercial paper outstanding. There was no outstanding commercial paper under the program during both 2024 and 2023. Cash Pooling We aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the United States, we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling arrangements, several IPG agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of set-off against amounts other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. Typically, each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash, net of bank overdrafts, under all of our pooling arrangements, and as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the amounts netted were $2,132.7 and $2,718.0, respectively. Note 6: Earnings Per Share The following sets forth basic and diluted earnings per common share available to IPG common stockholders.

Our acquisitions typically provide for an initial payment at the time of closing and additional contingent purchase price payments based on the future performance of the acquired entity. We have entered into agreements that may require us to purchase additional equity interests in certain consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries. The amounts at which we record these transactions in our financial statements are based on estimates of the future financial performance of the acquired entity, the timing of the exercise of these rights, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. During 2024, no acquisitions occurred and we did not record any additional goodwill or other intangible assets related to acquisitions. On December 3, 2024, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of an e-commerce intelligence platform, the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025 for a cash payment of $50.4, subject to customary closing adjustments. During 2023, we completed two acquisitions, one of which was included in the IA&C reportable segment, and one of which was included in the SC&E reportable segment. We paid $2.6, net of cash acquired and recorded approximately $11.7 of goodwill and $8.5 of other intangible assets related to the acquisitions. During 2022, we completed one acquisition, recorded in the MD&E reportable segment. On September 23, 2022, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire approximately 83.9% of the outstanding shares of RafterOne with options to purchase the remaining outstanding shares. The transaction closed on October 3, 2022, subject to customary closing adjustments. We paid $232.2, net of cash acquired, related to the acquisition. The purpose of the acquisition is to combine the Company's media, creative, marketing services and analytics capabilities, global scale and consumer insights, with RafterOne's Salesforce capabilities for commerce, service, data, marketing and customer experience. We recorded approximately $211.7 of goodwill, of which approximately $2.2 was recorded during 2023, and $62.0 of other intangible assets related to the acquisition of RafterOne. The results of operations of our acquired companies were included in our consolidated results from the closing date of each acquisition. We did not make any payments in stock related to our acquisitions in 2024, 2023 or 2022. Details of cash paid for current and prior years' acquisitions are listed below. Years ended December 31, Cost of investment: current-year acquisitions 235.4 Cost of investment: prior-year acquisitions Less: net cash acquired Total cost of investment 241.5 Operating payments Total cash paid for acquisitions 251.1 Represents cash payments for amounts that have been recognized in operating expenses since the date of acquisition either relating to adjustments to estimates in excess of the initial value of contingent payments recorded or were contingent upon the future employment of the former owners of the acquired companies. Amounts are reflected in the operating section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Of the total cash paid for acquisitions, $0.0, $6.3 and $232.2 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are classified under the investing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as acquisitions, net of cash acquired. These amounts relate to initial payments for new transactions, as well as adjustments made to upfront payments related to prior year acquisitions. Of the total cash paid for acquisitions, $9.0, $12.9 and $9.3 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are classified under the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as acquisition-related payments. These amounts relate to deferred payments and increases in our ownership interest for prior acquisitions. For companies acquired, we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities based on 100% of the business for consolidation. The purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets acquired is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and then to goodwill. Due to the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions typically do not have significant amounts of tangible assets since the principal assets we acquire are client relationships and talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is primarily allocated to customer lists, trade names and goodwill. For acquisitions, we record deferred payment and redeemable non-controlling interest amounts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on their acquisition-date fair value. Deferred payments are recorded on a discounted basis and adjusted quarterly, if necessary, through operating income or net interest expense, depending on the nature of the arrangement, for both changes in estimate and accretion between the acquisition date and the final payment date. See Note 17 for further information on contingent acquisition obligations. Redeemable non-controlling interests are adjusted quarterly, if necessary, to their estimated redemption value, but not less than their initial fair value. Any adjustments to the redemption value impact retained earnings or additional paid in capital, except for foreign currency translation adjustments. The following table presents changes in our redeemable non-controlling interests. Years ended December 31, Balance at beginning of period Change in related non-controlling interests balance Changes in redemption value of redeemable non-controlling interests: Additions Redemptions and other Redemption value adjustments Currency translation adjustments Balance at end of period For all acquisitions, if a portion of the deferred payments and purchases of additional interests after the effective date of purchase are contingent upon employment terms, then that amount is accounted for separately from the business combination and recognized as compensation expense over the required earn-out period. Payments deemed as compensation are excluded from the fair value purchase price allocation to tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired.

Accrued Liabilities The following table presents the components of accrued liabilities. December 31, Salaries, benefits and related expenses 432.1 507.5 Income taxes payable Interest Office and related expenses Acquisition obligations Restructuring charges Other Total accrued liabilities 661.6 705.8 Other (Expense) Income, Net Results of operations include certain items that are not directly associated with our revenue-producing operations. Years ended December 31, Net gains/(losses) on sales of businesses (64.2 (11.3 Other (11.7 Total other (expense) income, net (75.9 Net gains/(losses) on sales of businesses - During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amounts recognized were related to sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets and liabilities, consisting primarily of goodwill, accounts receivable and accounts payable, as held for sale within our MD&E, IA&C, and SC&E reportable segments. The businesses held for sale as of year-end primarily represent unprofitable, non-strategic agencies which are expected to be sold within the next twelve months. During 2024, the amounts recognized were primarily related to two digital specialist agencies within our MD&E segment classified as held for sale during the third quarter of 2024. The sale of one of these businesses closed in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the sale of the other is expected to close in the first half of 2025. The sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets and liabilities as held for sale included cash, net of proceeds, of $7.9, $58.7 and $(22.4) for the years ended 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which is classified within the Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold line in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Other - During 2024, the majority of the amounts recognized were primarily related to pension and postretirement costs. During 2023, the majority of the amounts recognized were primarily related to pension and postretirement costs. During 2022, the majority of the amounts recognized were primarily related to a cash gain from the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by a non-cash loss related to the deconsolidation of a previously consolidated entity in which we maintain an equity interest. Held for Sale Long-lived assets (disposal group) to be sold are classified as held for sale in the period which all criteria are met. The Company measures assets (disposal group) held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. During the third quarter of 2024, management determined that the assets and liabilities of R/GA, one of our digital specialist agencies within our MD&E segment, met the criteria to be presented as held for sale. The planned disposal is expected to be completed within twelve months of designation and does not constitute a strategic shift of the Company's operations and therefore does not meet the discontinued operations criteria. The Company recorded a loss within net losses on sales of businesses included in Other (expense) income, net, upon classification as held for sale for the disposal group to adjust its carrying value to fair value less cost to sell. This is presented as a valuation allowance of $71.1 on the group of assets held for sale, without allocation to the individual assets or major classes of assets within the group. Any differences due to changes in fair values less costs to sell or carrying values for the disposal group will be recognized as a gain or loss in future financial statements. See further discussion below in the \"Goodwill\" section within Note 9. The following table sets provides a reconciliation of the carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale, respectively, to the amounts presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.

On February 8, 2023, the Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $350.0, excluding fees, of our common stock, which was in addition to any amounts remaining under the 2022 share repurchase program. On February 7, 2024, the Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $320.0, excluding fees, of our common stock, which was in addition to any amounts remaining under the 2023 share repurchase program. On February 11, 2025, the Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $155.0, excluding fees, of our common stock, which was in addition to any amounts remaining under the 2024 share repurchase program. We may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") rules, derivative transactions or other means. The timing and amount of repurchases in future periods will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements. The following table presents our share repurchase activity under our share repurchase programs for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Years ended December 31, Number of shares repurchased Aggregate cost, including fees 230.1 350.2 320.1 Average price per share, including fees 31.40 33.64 31.01 The amount for twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 excludes $1.9 and $2.5 of estimated excise tax on net share repurchases, respectfully. We fully utilized the 2022 and 2023 share repurchase programs during the second quarter of 2023 and 2024, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, $170.1, excluding fees, remains available for repurchase under the 2024 share repurchase program. There are no expiration dates associated with the share repurchase programs.

Refunds of $53.0, $40.1 and $35.7 were received for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Note 9: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is the excess purchase price remaining from an acquisition after an allocation of purchase price has been made to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. The Company transferred certain agencies between operating segments as of January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024, respectively, which resulted in certain changes to our reporting units and reportable segments. We have allocated goodwill to our reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior and subsequent to the reallocations and determined that no impairment existed. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill for our reportable segments, MD&E, IA&C and SC&E, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are listed below. Total 1 Balance as of December 31, 2022 2,487.6 1,878.6 684.4 5,050.6 Goodwill Reallocation 180.6 (180.6 Balance as of January 1, 2023 2,668.2 1,698.0 684.4 5,050.6 Acquisitions/(Dispositions) Foreign currency and other Balance as of December 31, 2023 2,677.5 1,723.2 680.2 5,080.9 Goodwill Reallocation (13.3 Balance as of January 1, 2024 2,690.8 1,709.9 680.2 5,080.9 Impairment of goodwill (232.1 (232.1 (Dispositions)/Acquisitions (116.5 (117.6 Foreign currency and other (26.9 (41.8 Balance as of December 31, 2024 2,332.8 1,681.8 674.8 4,689.4 The amounts for our MD&E segment includes impairment of $24.9 related to a disposal group. The amounts for the year ended December 31, 2024 within our MD&E segment represents goodwill allocated to businesses which were held for sale as of the third quarter of 2024. The sale of one of these businesses closed in the fourth quarter of 2024. The goodwill balances at December 31, 2024 includes $207.2 of accumulated impairment related to the MD&E reportable segment. The accumulated impairment relates to impairment charges recorded during the third quarter of 2024. Q3 2024 Interim Goodwill Test During the third quarter of 2024, we concluded that declines in the forecasted performance of one of our reporting units included within our MD&E segment, combined with the classification of R/GA and Huge, which comprised a significant portion of the reporting unit, as held for sale was a triggering event which required a goodwill impairment assessment. As of August 31, 2024, we performed a pre-classification goodwill impairment test and determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and therefore, goodwill of the reporting unit was impaired. The Company completed an analysis to allocate goodwill to the remaining reporting unit, R/GA and Huge using a relative fair value approach. Additionally, we performed a post-classification goodwill impairment test on R/GA and Huge, as well as an impairment test of the businesses remaining within the reporting unit. We determined that the carrying value of one disposal group exceeded its fair value and goodwill was impaired. As a result of both the pre-classification and post-classification impairment tests, the Company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $232.1. We concluded that the fair value of the remaining reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and the remaining reporting unit was not impaired. The fair value of both the reporting unit pre-classification and the fair values of the disposal groups and the remaining reporting unit that is in our ongoing operations for which we performed the quantitative interim impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. We generally apply an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our quantitative impairment test analysis, although higher weighting was given to the market approach for determining the fair value of disposal groups. For the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to the reporting unit and disposal groups include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. For the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples. Additionally, our determination of the market approach for the disposal groups also considered ranges of initial offers received as part of the sale process. The discount rate used for the reporting unit and disposal groups is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. For the interim impairment tests of goodwill, the discount rates used ranged from 14.5% to 22.0%, and the terminal value growth rates were 2.5% and 3.0%. The terminal value growth rates represent the expected long-term growth rates. The revenue growth rates utilized in the interim impairment tests were between (2.0%) and 6.0%. Factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit and disposal groups provide for its clients, the geographic locations in which the reporting unit and disposal groups conduct business and the maturity of the reporting units and disposal groups. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and could result in an impairment charge in the future. See Note 1 for information regarding our annual impairment testing methodology. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets primarily consist of customer lists and know-how and technology, which have definite lives and are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 10 and 15 years, as well as trade names which have both indefinite and definite lives which are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives of 15 years. Amortization expense for other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $81.8, $84.0 and $84.7, respectively. There were no material impairment charges on other intangibles for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. During 2024 there were no other intangible assets related to our acquisitions, and during 2023 we recorded approximately $8.5 of other intangible assets related to our acquisitions. The following table provides a summary of other intangible assets, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. December 31, Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Amount Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Amount Customer lists 872.9 (474.0 398.9 882.1 (431.6 450.5 Know-how and technology 239.2 (166.4 239.5 (138.9 100.6 Trade names 225.5 (48.1 177.4 227.3 (45.7 181.6 Other Total 1,353.7 (693.8 659.9 1,365.1 (621.5 743.6 Total gross amount includes indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization of $165.3 and $165.7 in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which primarily consist of trade names.

In 2024, our effective income tax rate of 31.8% was negatively impacted by the net tax expense on entities classified as held for sale, a reduced tax benefit on impairment of goodwill, and by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. Our income tax expense was positively impacted by the reversal of reserves resulting from the lapse of statute for the 2020 federal tax year and the settlement of the 2017 through 2019 New York State income tax audit. The OECD's global tax reform initiative (known as Pillar 2) is aimed at ensuring multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax in all countries in which they operate, beginning with 2024. The adoption of these guidelines did not have a material impact on our current and deferred tax positions in 2024. In 2023, our effective income tax rate of 20.7% was positively impacted by a benefit of $64.2 related to the settlement of the 2017 and 2018 U.S. Federal income tax audit. The effective rate also benefited from the net release of previously recorded reserves for various other tax contingencies, and the excess tax benefits on employee share-based payments, the majority of which were recognized in the first quarter due to the timing of the vesting of awards. In 2022, our effective income tax rate of 25.1% was adversely impacted by the establishment of net valuation allowances primarily in Continental Europe, and by net losses on sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets as held for sale for which we received minimal tax benefit. This was partially offset by excess tax benefits on employee share-based payments, the majority of which were recognized in the first quarter due to the timing of the vesting of awards and by the release of previously recorded reserves for tax contingencies. The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are listed below.

We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. The realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced or increased in the near future if estimates of future taxable income are lower or greater than anticipated. A valuation allowance is established when it is \"more likely than not\" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance is considered. The factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence, such as past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent significant negative evidence, and as a result, we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets for which an allowance was recognized relate primarily to state and foreign tax loss carryforwards. The change in the valuation allowance is listed below. Years ended December 31, Balance at beginning of period 162.5 145.8 146.0 Charged (reversed) to costs and expenses Charged to gross tax assets and other accounts Foreign currency translation (11.3 Balance at end of period 173.1 162.5 145.8 Primarily represents changes to the valuation allowance related to the change of a corresponding deferred tax asset. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, amounts recorded and reversed to costs and expenses primarily related to increases and decreases in valuation allowances in Asia Pacific, Continental Europe and North America for existing deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2024, there were $872.9 of loss carryforwards. These loss carryforwards were all non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards, of which $772.0 have unlimited carryforward periods and $100.9 have expiration periods from 2025 to 2043. As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had $19.8 in deferred tax assets for state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, which will expire between 2025 and 2045. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $1,823.9 and $1,633.6, respectively, of undistributed earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries. The Company has historically asserted that its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested, and therefore has not recorded any deferred taxes on such amounts. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax on these undistributed earnings because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances that exist if and when a remittance occurs, including the source location and amount of the distribution and foreign withholding taxes. The table below summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits. Years ended December 31, Balance at beginning of period 291.0 283.5 262.6 Increases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior year Decreases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior year (34.4 (68.2 (10.1 Settlements with taxing authorities Lapse of statutes of limitation (16.3 (11.4 Increases as a result of tax positions taken during the current year Balance at end of period 305.8 291.0 283.5 Included in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $305.8 as of December 31, 2024, is $271.7 of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is $49.3 and $38.5, respectively, of which expenses of $10.8 and $2.5 are included in our 2024 and 2023 Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. In accordance with our accounting policy, interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have various tax years under examination by tax authorities in the U.S., in various countries, and in various states and localities, such as New York City, in which we have significant business operations. It is not yet known whether these examinations will, in the aggregate, result in our paying additional taxes. We believe our tax reserves are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and, if necessary, adjust our reserves as additional information or events require. With respect to all tax years open to examination by U.S. federal, various state and local, and non-U.S. tax authorities, we currently anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by an amount between $95.0 and $105.0 in the next twelve months, a portion of which will affect our effective income tax rate, primarily as a result of the settlement of tax examinations and the lapsing of statutes of limitations. This net decrease is related to various items of income and expense, primarily transfer pricing adjustments. We are effectively settled with respect to U.S. federal income tax audits through 2020. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local income tax audits for years prior to 2015 or non-U.S. income tax audits for years prior to 2011.

The amounts for the year ended December 31, 2022 represent 2022 Real Estate Actions, as well as adjustments to the actions taken in 2020. The 2022 Real Estate Actions did not include any severance and termination costs. Lease and Other restructuring costs include impairments of operating lease right-of-use assets and associated leasehold improvements, furniture and asset retirement obligations. Lease impairments were calculated based on estimated fair values using market participant assumptions including forecasted net discounted cash flows related to the operating lease right-of-use assets. 2022 Real Estate Actions In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company took Real Estate Actions related to new real estate exits and lease terminations to further optimize the real estate footprint supporting our office-home hybrid service model in a post-pandemic economy. All included opportunities for further efficiencies as a result of the current working environment were identified and completed during the fourth quarter of 2022. These Real Estate Actions, taken during the fourth quarter of 2022, reduced our occupied global real estate footprint by approximately 6.7% or 500,000 square feet. All restructuring actions were identified and initiated in 2022, with all actions completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. A summary of the restructuring activities related to the 2022 Real Estate Actions as of the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows: Liability at December 31, 2022 Real Estate Actions Restructuring Expense Non-Cash Items Payments Liability at December 31, 2024 Lease impairment costs Other restructuring costs Total A summary of the restructuring activities related to the 2022 Real Estate Actions as of the year ended December 31, 2023 is as follows: 2022 Real Estate Actions Liability at December 31, 2022 Restructuring Expense Non-Cash Items Payments Liability at December 31, 2023 Lease impairment costs Other restructuring costs Total A summary of the restructuring activities related to the 2022 Real Estate Actions as of the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: 2022 Real Estate Actions Restructuring Expense Non-Cash Items Cash Payments Liability at December 31, 2022 Lease impairment costs Other restructuring costs Total A summary of the restructuring activities related to the 2022 Real Estate Actions by segment is as follows: Years ended December 31, Restructuring charges: Corporate and other Total Non cash lease impairment costs: Corporate and other Total 2020 Restructuring Plan Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Company took restructuring actions to lower its operating expenses structurally and permanently relative to revenue and to accelerate the transformation of our business (the \"2020 Plan\"). All restructuring actions were identified and initiated in 2020, with all actions completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 and were based on our experience and learning in the COVID-19 pandemic and a resulting review of our operations to address certain operating expenses such as occupancy expense and salaries and related expenses.

In May 2019, our shareholders approved the 2019 Performance Incentive Plan (the \"2019 PIP\"), replacing the 2014 Performance Incentive Plan (the \"2014 PIP\") and previous incentive plans. The number of shares of common stock initially available for grants of all equity awards under the 2019 PIP is 27.0. Pursuant to the terms of the 2019 PIP, the number of shares that may be awarded to any one participant for any stock based awards is limited to 2.0. The vesting period of awards granted is generally commensurate with the requisite service period. We generally issue new shares to satisfy the exercise of stock options or the distribution of other stock-based awards. Additionally, under the 2019 PIP, we have the ability to issue performance cash awards. The performance cash awards are granted to certain employees who otherwise would have been eligible to receive performance-based stock awards. These awards have a service period vesting condition and a performance vesting condition. The amount of the performance cash award received by an employee with a performance vesting condition can range from 0% to 300% of the target amount of the original grant value, except for Executive Officers of IPG, with a range of 0% to 200%. Performance cash awards generally vest in three years. The Compensation Committee may grant performance cash awards to any eligible employee; however, no employee can receive more than $10.0 during a performance period. The amounts of stock-based compensation expense as reflected in salaries and related expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the related tax benefit, are listed below. Years ended December 31, Stock-settled awards Cash-settled awards Performance-based awards Stock Options Employee stock purchase plan Other Stock-based compensation expense Tax benefit Represents charges recorded for severance expense related to stock-based compensation awards. Stock Options Stock options are granted with the exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions including the option's expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. They are generally first exercisable between two and four years from the grant date and expire ten years after the grant date (or earlier in the case of certain terminations of employment). There were no stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2024, no stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2023 and no stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes our stock option activity during 2024. Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price (per option) Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Stock options outstanding as of January 1, 2024 23.33 Granted Exercised Stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2024 23.33 There were no stock options exercised in 2024, 2023, and 2022. Stock-Based Compensation We grant other stock-based compensation awards such as stock-settled awards, cash-settled awards and performance-based awards (settled in cash or shares) to certain key employees. The number of shares or units received by an employee for performance-based awards depends on Company performance against specific performance targets and could range from 0% to 300% of the target amount of shares originally granted, except for Executive Officers of IPG, with a range of 0% to 200%. Incentive awards are subject to certain restrictions and vesting requirements as determined by the Compensation Committee. The fair value of the shares on the grant date is amortized over the vesting period, which is generally three years. Upon completion of the vesting period for cash-settled awards, the grantee is entitled to receive a payment in cash based on the fair market value of the corresponding number of shares of common stock. No monetary consideration is paid by a recipient for any incentive award. The fair value of cash-settled awards is adjusted each quarter based on our share price. The holders of certain stock-settled awards have the right to receive dividends. Dividends declared on common stock are accrued during the vesting period and paid when the award vests. The holders of performance-based awards have no ownership interest in the underlying shares of common stock until the awards vest and the shares of common stock are issued. Stock-based compensation awards expected to be settled in cash have been classified as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Years ended December 31, Stock-Settled Awards: Awards granted Weighted-average grant-date fair value (per award) 31.39 35.54 36.36 Total fair value of vested awards distributed Cash-Settled Awards: Awards granted Weighted-average grant-date fair value (per award) 31.40 35.71 36.53 Total fair value of vested awards distributed Performance-Based Awards: Awards granted Weighted-average grant-date fair value (per award) 27.53 26.31 29.95 Total fair value of vested awards distributed In conjunction with common stock dividends declared in 2024 and 2023, we accrued dividends of $3.7 and $3.0, respectively, on non-vested stock-settled and cash-settled awards and paid dividends of $2.1 and $5.3 for stock-settled and cash-settled awards that vested during 2024 and 2023, respectively. A summary of the activity of our non-vested stock-settled awards, cash-settled awards and performance-based awards during 2024 is presented below (performance-based awards are shown at 100% of the shares originally granted). Stock-Settled Awards Cash-Settled Awards Performance-Based Awards Awards Weighted- Average Grant- Fair Value award) Awards Weighted- Average Grant- Fair Value award) Awards Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value (per award) Non-vested as of January 1, 2024 34.20 36.05 32.09 Reinstated 36.31 32.96 Granted 31.39 31.40 27.53 Vested 27.82 23.38 Forfeited 35.42 32.21 31.39 Non-vested as of December 31, 2024 34.08 32.64 29.86 Total unrecognized compensation expense remaining Weighted-average years expected to be recognized over In conjunction with our annual grant of long-term incentive compensation awards, we reviewed our estimates and assumptions in 2024, which resulted in a forfeiture rate slightly less than prior years. 2020 Restricted Cash Plan In November 2020, the Compensation Committee approved a new Interpublic Restricted Cash Plan, (collectively the \"Cash Plans\"). Under the Cash Plan, the Board, the Compensation Committee or the Plan Administrator may grant cash awards to certain employees eligible to receive cash-settled awards. Cash awards, when granted, have a service-period vesting condition and generally vest in two years or three years. Cash Awards During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Compensation Committee granted cash awards under the Cash Plans with a total target value of $17.1, $20.4 and $19.9, respectively. For those same years, we recognized $16.7, $31.5 and $42.0, respectively, in salaries and related expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Compensation Committee granted performance awards to be settled in cash under the 2019 PIP with a total target value of $1.5, $46.2, and $46.0, respectively. For those same years, we recognized $19.5, $38.0 and $44.7, respectively, in salaries and related expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We amortize the present value of the amount expected to vest for cash awards and performance cash awards over the vesting period using the straight-line method, less an assumed forfeiture rate. Cash awards do not fall within the scope of the authoritative guidance for stock compensation as they are not paid in equity and the value of the award is not correlated with our stock price. Due to the cash nature of the payouts and the vesting period, we account for these awards in accordance with authoritative guidance for deferred compensation arrangements. Employee Stock Purchase Plans In May 2016, our shareholders approved The Interpublic Group of Companies Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2016) (the \"ESPP\"), replacing the prior employee stock purchase plan under which, prior to its expiration on December 31, 2015, 3.0 shares were issued. Under the ESPP, eligible employees may purchase our common stock through payroll deductions not exceeding 10% of their eligible compensation or 900 (actual number) shares each offering period, consistent with the prior employee stock purchase plan. The price an employee pays for a share of common stock under the ESPP is 90% of the lesser of the average market price of a share on the first business day of the offering period or the average market price of a share on the last business day of the offering period of three months. An aggregate of approximately 10.0 shares are reserved for issuance under the ESPP, of which 3.7 shares have been issued since the inception of the ESPP through December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 0.6 shares with a value of $17.9 were issued under the ESPP. Note 14: Fair Value Measurements Authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Financial Instruments that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We primarily apply the market approach to determine the fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no changes to our valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of financial instruments during 2024 as compared to the prior year. The following tables present information about our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. December 31, 2024 Balance Sheet Classification Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Cash equivalents 1,139.5 1,139.5 Cash and cash equivalents Liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations Accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities December 31, 2023 Balance Sheet Classification Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Cash equivalents 1,521.5 1,521.5 Cash and cash equivalents Liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations Accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations includes deferred acquisition payments and unconditional obligations to purchase additional non-controlling equity shares of consolidated subsidiaries. Fair value measurement of the obligations is based upon actual and projected operating performance targets as specified in the related agreements. The increase in this balance of $2.4 from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 is primarily due to the exercises of redeemable non-controlling interest, as well as valuation adjustments, partially offset by payments related to our deferred acquisitions from prior-year acquisitions. The amounts payable within the next twelve months are classified in accrued liabilities; any amounts payable thereafter are classified in other non-current liabilities. Financial Instruments that are not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table presents information about our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total long-term debt 2,701.6 2,702.0 2,974.5 2,975.3 Our long-term debt is comprised of senior notes and other notes payable. The fair value of our senior notes, which are traded over-the-counter, is based on quoted prices in markets that are not active. Therefore, these senior notes are classified as Level 2. Our other notes payable are not actively traded, and their fair value is not solely derived from readily observable inputs. The fair value of our other notes payable is determined based on a discounted cash flow model and other proprietary valuation methods, and therefore is classified as Level 3. See Note 5 for further information on our long-term debt. The discount rates used as significant unobservable inputs in the Level 3 fair value measurements of our contingent acquisition obligations and long-term debt as of December 31, 2024 ranged from 4.0% to 6.0%. Non-financial Instruments that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Certain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, primarily goodwill (Level 3), intangible assets, and property and equipment. Accordingly, these assets are not measured and adjusted to fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to periodic evaluations for potential impairment. Note 15: Employee Benefits Pension and Postretirement Benefit We have a defined benefit pension plan covering certain U.S. employees (the \"Domestic Pension Plan\") that consists of approximately 2,600 participants and is closed to new participants. We also have numerous funded and unfunded plans outside the U.S. The Interpublic Limited Pension Plan in the U.K. (the \"U.K. Pension Plan\") is a defined benefit plan and is our most material foreign pension plan in terms of the benefit obligation and plan assets. Some of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries provide postretirement health benefits and life insurance to eligible employees and, in certain cases, their dependents. The domestic postretirement benefit plan is our most material postretirement benefit plan in terms of the benefit obligation. This plan consists of approximately 1,300 participants, is closed to new participants and is unfunded. Differences between the aggregate income statement and balance sheet amounts listed in the tables below and the totals reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets relate to non-material foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans. In December 2023, the U. K. Pension Plan entered into an agreement with an insurance company to purchase a group annuity, or \"buy-in\", that matches the plans future projected benefit obligations to covered participants. Prior to the transaction, the Company contributed an incremental $46.0 to the U.K. Pension Plan. As part of the annuity purchase contract, the U.K. Pension Plan has the option to complete a \"buy-out\", which would transfer all liabilities of the plan to the insurer, which the Company anticipates to be completed in 2026. The non-cash settlement charge, net of tax, associated with the transaction is currently estimated to be approximately $180.0 to $200.0 and is subject to finalization of terms and changes in the British Pound Sterling. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligation The change in the benefit obligation, the change in plan assets, the funded status and amounts recognized for the Domestic Pension Plan, the significant foreign pension plans and the domestic postretirement benefit plan are listed below.

Actuarial gains of $27.7 for the foreign pension plans are attributed to an increase in the weighted-average discount rate from 4.32% as of December 31, 2023 to 5.13% as of December 31, 2024 and changes in demographic experience.

Using the bond selection/settlement approach, we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments. Using the bond yield curve approach, we determine the discount rate by matching the plans' cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve. Both approaches utilize high-quality AA-rated corporate bonds and the plans' projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments, which is then used to develop a single discount rate. In countries where markets for high-quality long-term AA corporate bonds are not well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields, which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate. Expected Return on Assets Our expected rate of return is determined at the beginning of each year and considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions, current and expected market conditions, risk premiums associated with asset classes and long-term inflation rates. We determine both a short-term and long-term view and then select a long-term rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities. Fair Value of Pension Plan Assets The following table presents the fair value of our domestic and foreign pension plan assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. See Note 14 for a description of the fair value hierarchy. December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Plan assets subject to fair value hierarchy Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Registered investment companies Limited partnerships Fixed income securities Insurance contracts 291.0 292.3 334.4 335.8 Other Total plan assets, subject to leveling 291.0 324.1 334.4 362.4 Other Plan Assets Other investments measured at net asset value 106.5 Non-benefit obligation liabilities (40.2 Total plan assets 379.3 428.7 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy but are included to reconcile to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets table above. Registered investment companies, which are publicly traded, are primarily valued using recently reported sales prices. Limited partnerships are invested primarily in equity and fixed income securities. Fixed income securities include government and investment-grade corporate bonds. Insurance contracts are valued based on the cash surrender value of the contract. Other investments primarily include cash and cash equivalents, equity securities and derivatives. Other investments measured at net asset value include common/collective trusts, hedge funds and other commingled assets that are invested primarily in equity and fixed income securities. These investments are not publicly traded and are valued based on the net asset value of shares held by the plan at year end, which reflects the fair value of the underlying investments. The following table presents additional information about our significant foreign pension plan assets for which we utilize Level 3 inputs to determine fair value. Years ended December 31, Plan assets subject to fair value hierarchy, Level 3 Balance at beginning of period 334.4 Actual return on plan assets (43.4 Net purchases, sales and settlements 314.5 Balance at end of period 291.0 334.4 Asset Allocation The primary investment goal for our plans' assets is to maximize total asset returns while ensuring the plans' assets are available to fund the plans' liabilities as they become due. The plans' assets in aggregate and at the individual portfolio level are invested so that total portfolio risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best achieve this objective. The aggregate amount of our own stock held as investment for our domestic and foreign pension funds is considered negligible relative to the total fund assets. As of December 31, 2024, the weighted-average target and actual asset allocations relating to our domestic and foreign pension plans' assets are listed below. December 31, Asset Class 2025 Target Allocation Alternative investments Equity securities Fixed income securities Insurance contracts Liability driven investments Real estate & Other Total Alternative investments have the flexibility to dynamically invest across a broad range of asset classes including bonds, equity, cash, property and commodities. Liability driven investment strategies use government bonds as well as derivative instruments to hedge a portion of the impact of interest rates and inflation movements on the long-term liabilities. Cash Flows During 2024, we contributed $0.0 and $9.0 of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. For 2025, we expect to contribute approximately $0.0 and $9.0 of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. The estimated future benefit payments expected to be paid are presented below. Years Domestic Pension Plan Foreign Pension Plans Domestic Postretirement Benefit Plan 20302034 110.3 The estimated future payments for our domestic postretirement benefit plan are net of any estimated U.S. federal subsidies expected to be received under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which total no more than $0.2 in any individual year. Savings Plans sponsor defined contribution plans (the \"Savings Plans\") that cover substantially all domestic employees. The Savings Plans permit participants to make contributions on a pre-tax and/or after-tax basis and allow participants to choose among various investment alternatives. We match a portion of participant contributions based upon their years of service. Amounts expensed for the Savings Plans for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $67.6, $62.8 and $77.5, respectively. Expenses include a discretionary Company contribution of $0.0, $0.0 and $9.3 offset by participant forfeitures of $7.9, $5.8 and $6.3 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, we maintain defined contribution plans in various foreign countries and contributed $63.7, $62.5 and $58.2 to these plans in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Deferred Compensation and Benefit Arrangements We have deferred compensation and benefit arrangements which (i) permit certain of our key officers and employees to defer a portion of their salary or incentive compensation or (ii) require us to contribute an amount to the participant's account. These arrangements may provide participants with the amounts deferred plus interest upon attaining certain conditions, such as completing a certain number of years of service, attaining a certain age or upon retirement or termination. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the deferred compensation and deferred benefit liability balance was $105.4 and $126.5, respectively. Amounts expensed for deferred compensation and benefit arrangements in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $8.7, $10.7 and $2.1, respectively. We have purchased life insurance policies on participants' lives to assist in the funding of the related deferred compensation and deferred benefit liabilities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cash surrender value of these policies was $170.9 and $164.7, respectively. Long-Term Disability Plan We have a long-term disability plan which provides income replacement benefits to eligible participants who are unable to perform their job duties or any job related to his or her education, training or experience. As all income replacement benefits are fully insured, no related obligation is required as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. In addition to income replacement benefits, plan participants may remain covered for certain health and life insurance benefits up to normal retirement age, and accordingly, we have recorded an obligation of $7.3 and $5.3 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Note 16: Segment Information IPG's agency brands are grouped into reportable segments based on the agencies' primary capabilities. As of December 31, 2024, we have three reportable segments: MD&E, IA&C and SC&E. We also report results for the \"Corporate and other\" group. The MD&E segment provides, and is distinguished by innovative capabilities and scale in, global media and communications services, digital services and products, advertising and marketing technology, e-commerce services, data management and analytics, strategic consulting, and digital brand experience. MD&E is comprised of IPG Mediabrands, UM, Initiative, KINESSO, Acxiom and MRM. The IA&C segment provides advertising, corporate and brand identity services, and strategic consulting. IA&C is distinguished by the leading role of complex integrations of ideation and the execution of advertising and creative campaigns across all communications channels that are foundational to client brand identities. IA&C is comprised of leading global networks and agencies that provide a broad range of services, including McCann Worldgroup, IPG Health, MullenLowe Group, Foote, Cone & Belding (\"FCB\"), and our domestic integrated agencies. The SC&E segment provides best-in-class global public relations and other specialized communications services, events, sports and entertainment marketing, and strategic consulting. SC&E is comprised of agencies that provide a range of marketing services expertise, including Weber Shandwick, Golin, our sports, entertainment, and experiential agencies and IPG DXTRA Health. The Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") is the chief executive officer. The CODM evaluates each segments' operating performance based on segment EBITA, which is calculated as net income available to IPG common stockholders before provision for income taxes, total (expenses) and other income, equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, amortization of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill. Segment EBITA includes an allocation of a portion of centrally managed expenses described below. For all segments, the CODM uses segment EBITA in the annual budgeting and quarterly forecasting process and considers budget-to-actual current period to prior period variances to evaluate performance and make decisions regarding resource allocation for each segment. segments follow the same accounting policies as those described in Note 1. Corporate and other is primarily comprised of selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses includes corporate office expenses as well as shared service center and certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions; salaries, long-term incentives, annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees; professional fees related to internal control compliance, financial statement audits and legal, information technology and other consulting services that are engaged and managed through the corporate office; and rental expense for properties occupied by corporate office employees. A portion of centrally managed expenses is allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology-related projects, which are allocated based on utilization. Certain prior period amounts, wherever applicable, have been recast to reflect the transfer of certain agencies between our reportable segments. Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables.

Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies Guarantees We have guaranteed certain obligations of our subsidiaries relating principally to operating leases and uncommitted lines of credit of certain subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of parent company guarantees on lease obligations was $416.1 and $678.1, respectively, the amount of parent company guarantees primarily relating to uncommitted lines of credit was $256.6 and $255.7, respectively, and the amount of parent company guarantees related to daylight overdrafts, primarily utilized to manage intra-day overdrafts due to timing of transactions under cash pooling arrangements without resulting in incremental borrowings, was $79.6 and $85.5, respectively. In the event of non-payment by the applicable subsidiary of the obligations covered by a guarantee, we would be obligated to pay the amounts covered by that guarantee. As of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no material assets pledged as security for such parent company guarantees. Contingent Acquisition Obligations The following table details the estimated future contingent acquisition obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2024. Thereafter Total Deferred acquisition payments Redeemable non-controlling interests and call options with affiliates Total contingent acquisition payments We have entered into certain acquisitions that contain both redeemable non-controlling interests and call options with similar terms and conditions. The estimated amounts listed would be paid in the event of exercise at the earliest exercise date. We have certain redeemable non-controlling interests that are exercisable at the discretion of the non-controlling equity owners as of December 31, 2024. These estimated payments of $1.9 are included within the total payments expected to be made in 2025, and will continue to be carried forward into 2026 or beyond until exercised or expired. Redeemable non-controlling interests are included in the table at current exercise price payable in cash, not at applicable redemption value, in accordance with the authoritative guidance for classification and measurement of redeemable securities. The majority of these payments are contingent upon achieving projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject to revision in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements. See Note 7 for further information relating to the payment structure of our acquisitions. Legal Matters are involved in various legal proceedings, and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the normal course of business. The types of allegations that arise in connection with such legal proceedings vary in nature, but can include claims related to contract, employment, tax and intellectual property matters. We evaluate all cases each reporting period and record liabilities for losses from legal proceedings when we determine that it is probable that the outcome in a legal proceeding will be unfavorable and the amount, or potential range, of loss can be reasonably estimated. In certain cases, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages. While any outcome related to litigation or such governmental proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Note 18: Recent Accounting Standards Accounting pronouncements not listed below were assessed and determined to be not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance requiring additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and do not anticipate a material impact. Income Taxes In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring disaggregated information about an entity's effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as information on taxes paid. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Reporting In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance on segment reporting to improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analysis. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted the amended guidance for the year ended December 31, 2024, and applied the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For more detailed information about our reportable segments, see Note 16. Derivatives and Hedging In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance on hedge accounting which allows nonprepayable financial assets to be included in a closed portfolio hedge using the portfolio layer method, allowing for more consistent accounting over prepayable and nonprepayable hedges. The new guidance also allows multiple hedged layers to be designated for a single closed portfolio, further aligning hedge accounting with risk management strategies. We adopted the standard January 1, 2023, which did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 19: Subsequent Events We announced on February 12, 2025 that our Board had declared a common stock cash dividend of $0.330 per share, payable on March 17, 2025 to holders of record as of the close of business on March 3, 2025. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, management began initiating restructuring actions designed to transform our business, enhance our offerings and drive significant structural expense savings. Management is currently evaluating the actions to be included in the plan, some of which will be non-cash, and are subject to change upon finalization. Actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2025.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993674159049988}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9980155229568481}, {"label":

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) (Unaudited) Note 1: Basis of Presentation The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company,\" \"IPG,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") for reporting interim financial information on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include certain information and disclosures required for complete financial statements. The effects of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty have impacted and may continue to impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein reflect the latest estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods presented. The Company believes it has used reasonable estimates and assumptions to assess the fair values of goodwill, long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets; assessment of the annual effective tax rate; valuation of deferred income taxes and allowance for expected credit losses on future uncollectible accounts receivable. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and further decline in macroeconomic conditions or increasing interest rates could have a negative impact on these estimates, including the fair value of certain assets. The consolidated results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the \"2024 Annual Report\"). We conduct our business across three reportable segments described in Note 12. The three reportable segments are: Media, Data & Engagement Solutions (\"MD&E\"), Integrated Advertising & Creativity Led Solutions (\"IA&C\"), and Specialized Communications & Experiential Solutions (\"SC&E\"). Cost of services is comprised of the expenses of our revenue-producing reportable segments, including salaries and related expenses, office and other direct expenses and billable expenses, as well as an allocation of the centrally managed expenses from \"Corporate and Other\" group. Office and other direct expenses include rent expense, professional fees, certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and other costs directly attributable to client engagements. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily the unallocated expenses from Corporate and Other, excluding depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of the fixed assets and intangible assets of the Company is disclosed as a separate operating expense. Restructuring charges in 2025 consist of actions designed to transform our business, enhance our offerings and drive significant structural expense savings. In the opinion of management, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the information for each period contained therein. Certain reclassifications and immaterial adjustments have been made to prior-period financial statements to conform to the current-period presentation, including the recast of certain prior-period amounts to reflect the transfer of agencies between reportable segments. Note 2: Planned Acquisition of IPG by Omnicom December 8, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Omnicom Group Inc. (\"Omnicom\") and EXT Subsidiary Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom (\"Merger Sub\"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into IPG, with IPG surviving the merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom. a result of the merger, each share of IPG common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than certain excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.344 shares of Omnicom common stock and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares. The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to closing the merger. Following the close of the transaction, Omnicom shareholders will own 60.6% of the combined company and IPG shareholders will own 39.4%, on a fully diluted basis. As a result of the merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants. The stock-for-stock transaction is expected to be tax-free to IPG shareholders. On March 18, 2025, the shareholders of Omnicom and Interpublic each approved the acquisition of Interpublic at each company's special meeting of stockholders held that day. We have secured regulatory approvals for Omnicom's pending acquisition of IPG in all required jurisdictions other than the European Union (\"EU\"). We are continuing to pursue the required EU regulatory approval and expect that the acquisition will close by the end of November 2025. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if Omnicom terminates the agreement as a result of a willful and material breach of our non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, then we will be obligated to pay a termination fee of $439.0 to Omnicom (the \"IPG Termination Fee\"). We will also be obligated to pay the IPG Termination Fee if we breach the Merger Agreement in a manner that Omnicom's closing conditions not being satisfied and the breach cannot be cured by the specified outside date and, in any such case, within 12 months after the termination date a competing proposal to acquire 50% or more of the business, assets or outstanding shares of IPG has been publicly announced and consummated, or a definitive agreement in respect of such competing proposal has been signed. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, $22.8 and $38.5, respectively, of deal costs were incurred related to the planned acquisition of IPG by Omnicom. Deal costs comprised of legal, professional, filing fees, and retention-related compensation expenses were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses, with the exception of $4.1 recorded within salaries, benefits, and related expenses for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. On August 11, 2025, in connection with the planned merger, Omnicom commenced an offer to exchange any and all of our outstanding 4.650% Senior Notes due 2028, 4.750% Senior Notes due 2030, 2.400% Senior Notes due 2031, 5.375% Senior Notes due 2033, 3.375% Senior Notes due 2041, and 5.400% Senior Notes due 2048 (collectively, the \"IPG Senior Notes\") for up to $2.95 billion in aggregate principal amount of new Omnicom notes and cash, and solicited consents to amend the indentures governing the IPG Senior Notes (the \"Proposed Amendments\"). On August 25, 2025, Omnicom and IPG announced that Omnicom has received sufficient consents to consummate the consent solicitations, and that IPG executed a supplemental indenture (the \"New IPG Supplemental Indenture\") to the existing IPG indentures related to the IPG Senior Notes in order to effect the Proposed Amendments. The Proposed Amendments will become operative upon the consummation of the exchange offers, which are currently set to expire on November 28, 2025, subject to further extension, and which are subject to the closing of the merger and certain other conditions. Note 3: Revenue Disaggregation of Revenue We have three reportable segments as of September 30, 2025: MD&E, IA&C and SC&E, as further discussed in Note 12. MD&E principally generates revenue from providing global media and communications services, digital services and products, advertising and marketing technology, e-commerce services, data management and analytics, strategic consulting, and digital brand experience. IA&C principally generates revenue from providing advertising, corporate and brand identity services, and strategic consulting. SC&E generates revenue from providing best-in-class global public relations and communications services, events, sports and entertainment marketing, and strategic consulting. Our agencies are located in over 100 countries, including every significant world market. Our geographic revenue breakdown is listed below.

Contract liabilities relate to advance consideration received from customers under the terms of our contracts primarily related to reimbursements of third-party expenses, whether we act as principal or agent, and to a lesser extent, periodic retainer fees, both of which are generally recognized shortly after billing. The majority of our contracts are for periods of one year or less with the exception of our data management contracts. For those contracts with a term of more than one year, we had approximately $517.4 of unsatisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2025, which will be recognized as services are performed over the remaining contractual terms through 2030. Note 4: Debt and Credit Arrangements Long-Term Debt A summary of the carrying amounts of our long-term debt is listed below.

Refer to Note 13 for details. Credit Agreement We maintain a committed corporate credit facility, originally dated as of July 18, 2008, which has been amended and restated from time to time (the \"Credit Agreement\"). We use our Credit Agreement to increase our financial flexibility, to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries and to support our commercial paper program. On May 29, 2024, we amended and restated the Credit Agreement. As amended, among other things, the maturity date of the Credit Agreement was extended to May 29, 2029, and the cost structure of the Credit Agreement was changed. The Credit Agreement continues to include a required leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00, among other customary covenants, including limitations on our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary debt. At the election of the Company, the leverage ratio may be changed to not more than 4.00 to 1.00 for four consecutive quarters, beginning with the fiscal quarter in which there is an occurrence of one or more acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of at least $200.0. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $1,500.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. The Company has the ability to increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to $250.0, provided the Company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit of $50.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. As of September 30, 2025, there were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement; however, we had $9.1 of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, which reduced our total availability to $1,490.9. We were in compliance with all of our covenants in the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2025. Uncommitted Lines of Credit We also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates and that are primarily used to fund working capital needs. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit in an aggregate amount of $676.7, under which we had outstanding borrowings of $56.8 classified as short-term borrowings on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The average amount outstanding during the third quarter of 2025 was $40.2 with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 7.4%. Commercial Paper The Company is authorized to issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1,500.0. Borrowings under the program are supported by the Credit Agreement described above. Proceeds of the commercial paper are used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness and other short-term liquidity needs. The maturities of the commercial paper vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. During the third quarter of 2025, there was no commercial paper activity and, as of September 30, 2025, there was no commercial paper outstanding.

Other - During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amounts recognized were primarily related to pension and post-retirement costs, which were partially offset by changes in the fair market value of equity investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Share Repurchase Programs February 11, 2025, the Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $155.0, excluding fees, of our common stock. We may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") rules, derivative transactions or other means. The timing and amount of repurchases in future periods will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements. The following table presents our share repurchase activity under our share repurchase programs for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Nine months ended September 30, Number of shares repurchased Aggregate cost, including fees 257.4 230.1 Average price per share, including fees 25.39 31.40 The amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 excludes $2.1 and $1.9 of estimated excise tax on net share repurchases, respectively. As of September 30, 2025, $68.1, excluding fees, remains available for repurchase under the 2025 share repurchase program. There is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase program. Redeemable Non-controlling Interests Many of our acquisitions include provisions under which the non-controlling equity owners may require us to purchase additional interests in a subsidiary at their discretion. Redeemable non-controlling interests are adjusted quarterly, if necessary, to their estimated redemption value, but not less than their initial fair value. Any adjustments to the redemption value impact retained earnings or additional paid in capital, except for foreign currency translation adjustments. The following table presents changes in our redeemable non-controlling interests. Nine months ended September 30, Balance at beginning of period Change in related non-controlling interests balance Changes in redemption value of redeemable non-controlling interests: Additions Redemptions and other (15.6 Redemption value adjustments (20.2 Currency translation adjustments Balance at end of period Held for Sale Long-lived assets (disposal groups) to be sold are classified as held for sale in the period which all criteria are met. The Company measures assets (disposal group) held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. During the third quarter of 2025, management determined that the assets and liabilities of an agency within our SC&E segment, met the criteria to be presented as held for sale. The planned disposal is expected to be completed within twelve months of designation and does not constitute a strategic shift of the Company's operations and therefore does not meet the discontinued operations criteria. Any differences due to changes in fair values less costs to sell or carrying values for disposal groups will be recognized as a gain or loss in future financial statements. See further discussion below in the \"Goodwill\" section within Note 6. The following table sets provides a reconciliation of the carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale, respectively, to the amounts presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2025. September 30, 2025 ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable Accounts receivable, billable to clients Other current assets Goodwill and other intangibles Deferred income taxes Other non-current assets TOTAL ASSETS HELD FOR SALE 196.0 LIABILITIES: Accounts payable 117.0 Accrued liabilities Other current Liabilities Other non-current liabilities TOTAL LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE 121.3 NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Goodwill Goodwill is the excess purchase price remaining from an acquisition after an allocation of purchase price has been made to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. During the third quarter of 2025, an agency that comprised a significant portion of a reporting unit within our SC&E segment was classified as held for sale. Additionally, the Company transferred certain agencies between operating segments as of January 1, 2025, April 1, 2025 and September 1, 2025. The agency transfers that occurred as of April 1, 2025 resulted in certain changes to our reporting units and reportable segments. We have allocated goodwill to our reporting units, including the remaining reporting unit subsequent to the held for sale classification, using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all impacted reporting units immediately prior and subsequent to the reallocations, and held for sale classification, and determined that no impairment existed. The following table sets forth details of changes in goodwill by reportable segment of the Company: Total Balance at December 31, 2024 2,332.8 1,681.8 674.8 4,689.4 Goodwill Reallocation Acquisitions/(Dispositions) (45.0 Foreign currency and other Balance at September 30, 2025 2,398.4 1,714.7 637.3 4,750.4 The goodwill balances at December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025 include $207.2 of accumulated impairment within the MD&E reportable segment. The amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 within our MD&E segment is due to the acquisition of an e-commerce, intelligence platform, for which we paid $54.2, net of cash acquired. The amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 within our SC&E segment represents goodwill allocated to a business which is held for sale. Note 7: Income Taxes For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, our income tax rate was negatively impacted by losses related to the disposition of previously held for sale entities for which we recorded a nominal tax benefit and by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. This was partially offset by the release of previously recorded reserves for tax contingencies. On July 4, 2025, the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" (OBBBA) was signed into law in the U.S., which contains a broad range of significant tax reform provisions. The Company is currently evaluating the full effects of these legislative changes and does not anticipate a material impact. We have various tax years under examination by tax authorities in the U.S., in various countries, and in various states and localities, such as New York City, in which we have significant business operations. It is not yet known whether these examinations will, in the aggregate, result in our paying additional taxes. We believe our tax reserves are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and, if necessary, adjust our reserves as additional information or events require. With respect to all tax years open to examination by U.S. federal, various state and local, and non-U.S. authorities, we currently anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by an amount between $90.0 and $100.0 in the next twelve months, a portion of which will affect our effective income tax rate, primarily as a result of the settlement of tax examinations and the lapsing of statutes of limitations. This net decrease is related to various items of income and expense, primarily transfer pricing adjustments. We are effectively settled with respect to U.S. federal income tax audits through 2020. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local income tax audits for years prior to 2015 or non-U.S. income tax audits for years prior to 2011. Note 8: Restructuring Charges Restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 consist of new actions taken in the first nine months of 2025. Restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 represent adjustments to the 2022 Real Estate Actions, as well as adjustments to the actions taken in 2020. The components of restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are listed below. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, Severance and termination costs 177.7 Lease impairment costs 108.0 Other related costs 165.1 Total restructuring charges 129.5 450.8 2025 Restructuring Actions In the first quarter of 2025, management initiated restructuring actions, as previously disclosed, which are designed to transform our business, enhance our offerings and drive significant structural expense savings. Management currently expects the total charges in connection with these actions to be approximately $450.0 - $475.0, a portion being non-cash, which is subject to change upon finalization of the actions. Actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2025. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, severance and termination costs related to a planned reduction in workforce of approximately 800 employees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, severance and termination costs related to a planned reduction in workforce of approximately 3,200 employees. The employee groups affected include executive, regional and account management as well as administrative, creative and media production personnel. Lease impairment costs, which relate to the office spaces that were vacated as part of the 2025 restructuring actions and reduced our occupied global real estate footprint by approximately 135,000 and 730,000 square feet for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, included impairments of operating lease right-of-use assets. Lease impairments were calculated based on estimated fair values using market participant assumptions including forecasted net discounted cash flows related to the operating lease right-of-use assets. Other related costs primarily include leasehold improvements and furniture and asset retirement obligations associated with office spaces vacated as part of the 2025 restructuring actions, third-party costs to assist in identifying areas of structural expense savings in relation to our restructuring initiatives, write-offs of unutilized assets, and losses on sales of equity and debt investments. Leasehold improvements and furniture and asset retirement obligations were estimated using market participant assumptions including forecasted net discounted cash flows. A summary of the restructuring activities related to the 2025 restructuring actions is as follows: 2025 Restructuring Actions Restructuring Expense Non-Cash Items Payments Liability at September 30, Severance and termination costs 177.7 122.0 Lease impairment costs 108.0 107.8 Other related costs 165.1 Total 450.8 179.8 196.1 2022 Real Estate Actions & 2020 Restructuring Plan There were no adjustments to the 2020 Plan and 2022 Real Estate Actions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Net restructuring charges of $0.5 and $1.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively were related to adjustments to our restructuring actions taken in 2020 and 2022. Note 9: Incentive Compensation Plans We issue stock-based compensation and cash awards to our employees under various plans established by the Compensation and Leadership Talent Committee of the Board of Directors (the \"Compensation Committee\") and approved by our stockholders. We issued the following stock-based awards under the 2019 Performance Incentive Plan (the \"2019 PIP\") during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Awards Weighted-average grant-date fair value (per award) Restricted stock (units) 27.07 Performance-based stock (shares) 23.64 Cash-settled awards 27.19 Total stock-based compensation awards During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Compensation Committee granted performance cash awards under the 2019 PIP and restricted cash awards under the 2020 Restricted Cash Plan with a total annual target value of $1.3 and $8.7, respectively. Cash awards are expensed over the vesting period, which is typically three years for performance cash awards and two years or three years for restricted cash awards. Note 10: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, Net of Tax The following tables present the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, by component. Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Derivative Instruments Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Total Balance as of December 31, 2024 (940.8 (202.5 (1,112.6 Other comprehensive income before reclassifications 189.2 189.2 Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax Balance as of September 30, 2025 (731.3 (191.1 (893.9 Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Derivative Instruments Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Total Balance as of December 31, 2023 (789.1 (190.6 (946.2 Other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax Balance as of September 30, 2024 (791.7 (185.8 (946.1 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are as follows: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, Affected Line Item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations Foreign currency translation adjustments Other expense, net Net gain on derivative instruments Other expense, net, Interest expense Amortization of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan items Other expense, net Tax effect Provision for income taxes Total amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax Note 11: Employee Benefits We have a defined benefit pension plan that covers certain U.S. employees (the \"Domestic Pension Plan\"). We also have numerous funded and unfunded plans outside the U.S. The Interpublic Limited Pension Plan in the U.K. (the \"U.K. Pension Plan\") is a defined benefit plan and is our most material foreign pension plan in terms of the benefit obligation and plan assets. Some of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries provide postretirement health benefits and life insurance to eligible employees and, in certain cases, their dependents. The domestic postretirement benefit plan is our most material postretirement benefit plan in terms of the benefit obligation. Certain immaterial foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans have been excluded from the table below. In December 2023, the U.K. Pension Plan entered into an agreement with an insurance company to purchase a group annuity, or \"buy-in\", that matches the plan's future projected benefit obligations to covered participants. As part of the annuity purchase contract, the U.K. Pension Plan has the option to complete a \"buy-out\", which would transfer all liabilities of the plan to the insurer, which the Company anticipates to be completed in 2026. The non-cash settlement charge, net of tax, associated with the transaction is currently estimated to be approximately $180.0 to $200.0 and is subject to finalization of terms and changes in the British Pound Sterling. In June 2025, participants of our Domestic Pension Plan were provided the option to request lump sum distributions, which resulted in a partial settlement of the plan. The lump sum election window ended August 4, 2025. A non-cash settlement charge, net of tax, of $6.5 was incurred in the third quarter of 2025. The Company also expects to make an incremental contribution to the plan in the fourth quarter of 2025 of approximately $16.0. The components of net periodic cost for the Domestic Pension Plan, the significant foreign pension plans and the domestic postretirement benefit plan are listed below. Domestic Pension Foreign Pension Plans Domestic Postretirement Benefit Plan Three Months Ended September 30, Service cost Interest cost Expected return on plan assets Settlements Amortization of: Prior service cost Unrecognized actuarial losses Net periodic cost Domestic Pension Foreign Pension Plans Domestic Postretirement Benefit Plan Nine Months Ended September 30, Service cost Interest cost Expected return on plan assets (12.9 (11.1 Settlements Amortization of: Prior service cost Unrecognized actuarial losses Net periodic cost The components of net periodic cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item \"Other expense, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we contributed $0.0 and $7.4 of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. For the remainder of 2025, we expect to contribute approximately $16.0 and $2.0 of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. Note 12: Segment Information IPG's agency brands are grouped into reportable segments based on the agencies' primary capabilities. As of September 30, 2025, we have three reportable segments: MD&E, IA&C, and SC&E. We also report results for the \"Corporate and other\" group. MD&E primarily provides, and is distinguished by innovative capabilities and scale in, global media and communications services, digital services and products, advertising and marketing technology, e-commerce services, data management and analytics, strategic consulting, and digital brand experience. MD&E is comprised of IPG Mediabrands, UM, Initiative, KINESSO, Acxiom and MRM. IA&C primarily provides advertising, corporate and brand identity services, and strategic consulting. IA&C is distinguished by the leading role of complex integrations of ideation and the execution of advertising and creative campaigns across all communications channels that are foundational to client brand identities. IA&C is comprised of leading global networks and agencies that provide a broad range of services, including McCann Worldgroup, IPG Health, MullenLowe Group, Foote, Cone & Belding (\"FCB\"), and our domestic integrated agencies. SC&E primarily provides best-in-class global public relations and other specialized communications services, events, sports and entertainment marketing, and strategic consulting. SC&E is comprised of agencies that provide a range of marketing services expertise, including Weber Shandwick, Golin, our sports, entertainment, and experiential agencies, and IPG DXTRA Health. Certain prior period amounts, wherever applicable, have been recast to reflect the transfer of certain agencies between reportable segments. We continue to evaluate our financial reporting structure, and the profitability measure employed by our chief operating decision maker for allocating resources to operating divisions and assessing operating division performance is segment EBITA. Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following table. Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 Total Total revenue 954.1 940.1 599.8 2,494.0 Revenue before billable expenses 938.8 848.1 348.7 2,135.6 Base salaries, benefits and tax 498.4 523.0 210.6 Incentive expense Severance expense Temporary help Office and other direct expenses 164.0 Depreciation and amortization Restructuring charges Other segment items 104.9 254.2 Segment EBITA 173.5 117.8 350.7 Amortization of acquired intangibles Capital expenditures Excludes amortization of acquired intangibles.

Note 13: Fair Value Measurements Authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Financial Instruments that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We primarily apply the market approach to determine the fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no changes to our valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of financial instruments during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The following tables present information about our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. September 30, 2025 Balance Sheet Classification Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Cash equivalents 721.5 721.5 Cash and cash equivalents Liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations Accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities December 31, 2024 Balance Sheet Classification Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Cash equivalents 1,139.5 1,139.5 Cash and cash equivalents Liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations Accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations includes deferred acquisition payments and unconditional obligations to purchase additional non-controlling equity shares of consolidated subsidiaries. Fair value measurement of the obligations is based upon actual and projected operating performance targets as specified in the related agreements. The decrease in this balance of $(5.2) from December 31, 2024 to September 30, 2025 is primarily due to payments related to our deferred acquisitions payments from prior-year acquisitions. The amounts payable within the next twelve months are classified in accrued liabilities; any amounts payable thereafter are classified in other non-current liabilities. Financial Instruments that are not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table presents information about our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total long-term debt 2,751.6 2,751.9 2,701.6 2,702.0 Our long-term debt is comprised of senior notes and other notes payable. The fair value of our senior notes, which are traded over-the-counter, is based on quoted prices in markets that are not active. Therefore, these senior notes are classified as Level 2. Our other notes payable are not actively traded, and their fair value is not solely derived from readily observable inputs. The fair value of our other notes payable is determined based on a discounted cash flow model and other proprietary valuation methods, and therefore is classified as Level 3. See Note 4 for further information on our long-term debt. The discount rates used as significant unobservable inputs in the Level 3 fair value measurements of our contingent acquisition obligations and long-term debt as of September 30, 2025 ranged from 4.0% to 6.0%. Non-financial Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Certain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, primarily goodwill (Level 3), intangible assets, and property and equipment. Accordingly, these assets are not measured and adjusted to fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to periodic evaluations for potential impairment. Note 14: Commitments and Contingencies Guarantees As discussed in our 2024 Annual Report, we have guaranteed certain obligations of our subsidiaries relating principally to operating leases and uncommitted lines of credit of certain subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the amount of parent company guarantees on lease obligations was $364.7 and $416.1, respectively, the amount of parent company guarantees primarily relating to uncommitted lines of credit was $245.7 and $256.6, respectively, and the amount of parent company guarantees related to daylight overdrafts, primarily utilized to manage intra-day overdrafts due to timing of transactions under cash pooling arrangements without resulting in incremental borrowings, was $86.4 and $79.6, respectively. In the event of non-payment by the applicable subsidiary of the obligations covered by a guarantee, we would be obligated to pay the amounts covered by that guarantee. As of both September 30, 2025, and December 31, 2024 there were no material assets pledged as security for such parent company guarantees. Legal Matters We are involved in various legal proceedings, and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the normal course of business. The types of allegations that arise in connection with such legal proceedings vary in nature, but can include claims related to contract, employment, tax and intellectual property matters. We evaluate all cases each reporting period and record liabilities for losses from legal proceedings when we determine that it is probable that the outcome in a legal proceeding will be unfavorable and the amount, or potential range, of loss can be reasonably estimated. In certain cases, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages. While any outcome related to litigation or such governmental proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Note 15: Recent Accounting Standards Accounting pronouncements not listed below were assessed and determined to be not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. IntangiblesGoodwill and Other In September 2025, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance to increase the operability of the recognition guidance considering different methods of software development. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2027 and interim periods within those annual reporting periods. We are currently evaluating the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and do not anticipate a material impact. Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance requiring additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and do not anticipate a material impact. Income Taxes In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring disaggregated information about an entity's effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as information on taxes paid. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We do not anticipate that the expanded disclosure requirements will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score":

INFORMATION AS AT AND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2025, AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 Exhibit 99.1 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On December 8, 2024, Omnicom Group Inc. (\"Omnicom\") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\"), by and among Omnicom, EXT Subsidiary Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom (\"Merger Sub\"), and The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (\"IPG\"), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into IPG (the \"Merger\"), with IPG surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom. Each share of IPG common stock will be converted into, and represent the right to receive, 0.344 shares of common stock of Omnicom, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Omnicom common stock that otherwise would have been issued. On March 18, 2025, the shareholders of each of Omnicom and IPG approved the Merger. The completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals. We have secured regulatory approvals for Omnicom's pending acquisition of IPG in all required jurisdictions and expect to close the Merger by the close of business on November 26, 2025. The Merger is not subject to a financing condition or the completion of the Exchange Offers or Consent Solicitations announced by Omnicom and IPG on August 11, 2025 related to IPG's outstanding senior notes (the \"Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations\"). Omnicom has received sufficient tenders and consents to consummate the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, which are currently set to expire on November 28, 2025. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared from the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Omnicom and IPG and reflect transaction accounting adjustments related to the Merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 are presented as if the Merger had been completed on January 1, 2024. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2025 is presented as if the Merger had been completed on September 30, 2025. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been developed from and should be read in conjunction with: the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Omnicom included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2025; the unaudited consolidated financial statements of IPG included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2025; the audited consolidated financial statements of Omnicom included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024; the audited consolidated financial statements of IPG included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024; and other information relating to Omnicom and IPG contained in reports filed by Omnicom or IPG, as applicable, with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared to reflect adjustments to Omnicom's historical consolidated financial information representing Omnicom management's estimates based on information available as of November 26, 2025 and are subject to change as additional information becomes available and analyses are performed. However, Omnicom management believes that the assumptions provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects of the Merger as contemplated, and that the pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions and are properly applied in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect the following adjustments, which include transaction accounting adjustments: the reclassification of certain items within IPG's historical presentation to conform to Omnicom's financial statement presentation; the Merger, using the acquisition method of accounting, with Omnicom as the accounting acquirer and each share of IPG common stock converted into 0.344 shares of Omnicom common stock; and estimated purchase accounting adjustments and related impacts on the balance sheet and income statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Omnicom has been treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes, primarily due to Omnicom stockholders holding majority voting interests in the combined company, Omnicom issuing equity interests to effect the Merger and the management of Omnicom continuing to manage the combined entity. Thus, Omnicom will account for the Merger as a business combination in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations The total purchase price will be allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their respective fair values. The fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of IPG have been measured based on various preliminary estimates using assumptions that Omnicom management believes are reasonable and based on currently available information. Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The final purchase accounting could be materially different from the preliminary estimates used to prepare the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements which could have a material impact on the combined company's future results of operations and financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based on the aforementioned historical financial statements and the assumptions and adjustments as described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The pro forma adjustments reflect transaction accounting adjustments related to the Merger, which are discussed in further detail below. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent the combined company's consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position that would actually have occurred had the Merger been consummated on the dates assumed or to project the combined company's consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position for any future date or period. The accounting policies followed in preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are those used by Omnicom as set forth in Omnicom's audited historical financial statements. Based on Omnicom's initial review and understanding of IPG's summary of significant accounting policies included in IPG's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, management is not aware of any material differences to conform IPG's historical financial information to Omnicom's significant accounting policies. A more comprehensive comparison and assessment will occur, which may result in additional differences identified. Additionally, Omnicom has included certain reclassifications for consistency in the financial statement presentation, including with respect to certain IPG restructuring charges. These reclassifications have no effect on the previously reported total assets, total liabilities and shareholders' equity, or net income of Omnicom or IPG. See Notes 2 and 3 in the Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements for more information. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the costs of any post close integration activities, severance, or impairments, or any cost savings or synergies that may be achieved because of the Merger or costs to achieve the synergies. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to the estimated impacts of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations. IPG and Omnicom have not had any historical material relationship prior to the Merger. Accordingly, no pro forma adjustments were required to eliminate activities between the companies.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Description of the Merger and Basis of Pro Forma Presentation On December 8, 2024, Omnicom Group Inc. (\"Omnicom\") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\"), by and among Omnicom, EXT Subsidiary Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom (\"Merger Sub\"), and The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (\"IPG\"), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into IPG (the \"Merger\"), with IPG surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom. Each share of IPG common stock will be converted into, and represent the right to receive, 0.344 shares of common stock of Omnicom, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Omnicom common stock that otherwise would have been issued. On March 18, 2025, the shareholders of each of Omnicom and IPG approved the Merger. The completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals. We have secured regulatory approvals for Omnicom's pending acquisition of IPG in all required jurisdictions and expect to close the Merger by the close of business on November 26, 2025. The Merger is not subject to a financing condition or the completion of the Exchange Offers or Consent Solicitations announced by Omnicom and IPG on August 11, 2025 related to IPG's outstanding senior notes (the \"Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations\"). Omnicom has received sufficient tenders and consents to consummate the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, which are currently set to expire on November 28, 2025. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared from the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Omnicom and IPG and reflect transaction accounting adjustments related to the Merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 have been presented as if the Merger had been completed on January 1, 2024. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2025 has been presented as if the Merger had occurred on September 30, 2025. Certain balance sheet and statements of income reclassifications have been made to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in order to align historical presentation between Omnicom and IPG. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for a discussion of these reclassification adjustments. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, and Omnicom is considered the accounting acquirer. The acquisition method of accounting, based on ASC 805, uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\"ASC 820\"). Fair value is defined in ASC 820 as the \"price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\" This is an exit price concept for the valuation of an asset or liability. Market participants are assumed to be buyers or sellers in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Fair value measurement for an asset assumes the highest and best use by these market participants, and as a result, assets may be required to be recorded which are not intended to be used or sold and/or at a fair value measurement that does not reflect management's intended use for those assets. Fair value measurements can be highly subjective, and it is possible the application of reasonable judgment could develop different assumptions resulting in a range of alternative estimates using the same facts and circumstances. ASC 805 requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at fair value as of the Merger date, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. As of November 26, 2025, the accompanying unaudited estimated purchase price allocation is preliminary and is subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. The potential changes to the purchase price allocation and related pro forma adjustments could be material. For the purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, Omnicom's management has conducted a preliminary analysis of the adjustments required to conform IPG's financial statements to reflect the current accounting policies of Omnicom. This assessment is ongoing, and, at the time of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, management is not aware of any material accounting policy differences. Upon consummation of the Merger, Omnicom management will conduct a final review of IPG's accounting policies to determine if differences in accounting policies or financial statement classification exist that may require adjustments to or reclassification of IPG's results of operations, assets or liabilities to conform to Omnicom's accounting policies and classifications. As a result of that review, differences may be identified that, when conformed, could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Summary of Reclassification Adjustments Balance Sheet The classification of certain balance sheet items presented by IPG under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") has been adjusted to align with the presentation used by Omnicom under GAAP, as shown below.

Omnicom share price is as of the close of business November 19, 2025. The actual value of the shares of Omnicom common stock to be issued in the Merger will depend on the market price of shares of Omnicom common stock at the closing date of the Merger, and therefore the actual consideration will fluctuate based on the market price of the shares of Omnicom common stock. Accordingly, the final consideration could differ significantly from the current estimate. A 10% increase or decrease in Omnicom's share price would increase or decrease the consideration by approximately $895.4 million and impact goodwill by a corresponding amount. Represents the historical share-based awards that will be replaced and cash settled by Omnicom. Refer to (i) in Note 5 below (Pro forma adjustments). Consideration paid for fractional shares is immaterial. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total consideration is allocated to IPG's assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of completion of the Merger. Based upon the estimated purchase price and a preliminary valuation, the preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows: Preliminary purchase price allocation As of September 30, Cash and cash equivalents 1,531.2 Accounts receivable 4,946.4 Work in process 2,073.6 Assets held for sale 196.0 Other current assets 664.1 Property and Equipment 319.2 Operating lease right-of-use assets 831.1 Equity method investments Goodwill 7,356.1 Intangible assets 4,105.7 Other assets 786.6 Total assets 22,849.2 Accounts payable 7,108.5 Customer advances 595.7 Current portion of debt Short-term debt Liabilities held for sale 121.3 Other current liabilities 875.1 Long-term liabilities 495.4 Long-term liability - operating leases 919.0 Long-term debt 2,751.9 Deferred tax liabilities 803.6 Non-controlling interests Redeemable noncontrolling interests Total liabilities and noncontrolling interests 13,782.6 Total Consideration 9,066.6 The purchase price estimates and the purchase price allocation are preliminary and are subject to change based on the Omnicom share price at the closing date of the Merger, as well as the actual net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities that exist on the closing date of the Merger, and the value of certain tax contingencies. The purchase price allocation related to certain tangible and intangible assets and liabilities is ongoing. This includes, but is not limited to, items such as property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, and redeemable noncontrolling interests. The final determination of the purchase price allocation will be completed as soon as practicable after the completion of the Merger and will be based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The final amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed could differ significantly from the amounts presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on how the consideration and purchase price allocation have been reflected in the pro forma adjustments. Forma Adjustments The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflects the following adjustments. Acquisition of all outstanding shares of IPG common stock. As of September 30, Shares of Omnicom issued to IPG stockholders (Common stock) Shares of Omnicom issued to IPG stockholders (Additional paid-in capital) 8,934.9 Total equity consideration 8,953.6 Purchase price allocation (the amounts below represent changes; refer to Note 4 for preliminary fair value estimates). The adjustments as a result of the purchase price allocation include the recognition of new intangible assets, net of the removal of historical intangible assets, the recognition of new goodwill, net of the removal of historical goodwill, adjustment to the fair value of the debt, and adjustment to the fair value of deferred taxes to reflect the after tax basis difference of the intangible assets. As of September 30, Adjustments to: Intangible assets 3,307.2 Goodwill 2,605.7 (171.1 Deferred income taxes 566.1 The identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of trade names, customer relationships and technology with estimated fair values of $973.0 million, $2,886.0 million and $246.7 million, respectively. Trade names, customer relationships and technology are amortized straight-line over estimated remaining useful lives of 15 years, 10 years and 5 years, respectively. The fair values for intangible assets were estimated using a market participant approach. The fair values for trade names were estimated by applying the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. The fair values for customer relationships were estimated using the profit contribution method under the income approach. The current estimate of fair values for the technology intangible assets were estimated based on the historical book value of the similar assets. The final purchase price allocation for intangible assets could materially differ from the estimates. A ten percent increase in the value of the acquired intangible assets would increase the intangible assets by $410.6 million and result in a corresponding increase to amortization expense of $77.0 million. Deferred income taxes were adjusted to include deferred tax liabilities related to the identified intangible assets that will be amortized. In addition, estimates were made to deferred taxes related to net operating losses that may not be utilized and withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that may be required in certain jurisdictions of the combined entities (see (f) below). Reflects adjustments to equity related to: eliminate IPG historical equity of $3,656.8 million; and give effect to the transaction costs adjustment of $140.0 million described in (d) to retained earnings. As of September 30, 2025 Common stock (37.4 Additional paid-in capital (478.1 Retained earnings (4,434.7 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 893.9 Treasury stock, at cost 259.5 Total (3,796.8 Represents the accrual of direct and incremental transaction costs expected to be incurred after September 30, 2025, in connection with the closing of the Merger, which are non-recurring. The estimate is based on Omnicom management's judgment after evaluating several factors, including evaluating its most recent overall expected budget for transaction costs and amounts contractually due to external advisors and service providers. These costs will not affect Omnicom's income statement beyond 12 months after the acquisition date and costs related to future integration activities are not included in this estimate. The historical income statements of Omnicom include acquisition related costs of $175.4 million ($14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $160.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025). Year Ended December 31, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Acquisition-related costs 140.0 Incremental amortization resulting from the preliminary allocation of purchase price. Year Ended December 31, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Incremental amortization 284.3 209.3 Adjusts the deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets as a result of the Merger. An increase to deferred tax liabilities was recorded as part of the allocation of purchase price in adjustment (b) above.

The expense for any awards with a remaining service period after the closing date has been included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. IPG cash-based and share-based awards include a change of control provision that requires payment upon both a change of control event and subsequent termination (double trigger). Adjustments have been made for certain awards that had a double trigger which accelerated the vesting. Where no determination has been made in relation to the double trigger and whether both criteria requiring payment upon a change in control would be satisfied, no acceleration has been made. adjustment below reflects the impact to selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") for those employees whose compensation expense was included within SG&A and Salary and related for those employees included within Salary and related.

On November 26, 2025, the Company reported that a subsidiary of Genesis Legacy Solutions, Inc. (\"GLS\"), pursuant to the terms of the reinsurance contract, demanded and is currently engaged in an arbitration with one of its ceding companies. Under the subject reinsurance agreement, GLS provides the ceding company in question with (i) reinsurance premium protection (\"RPP\") coverage with aggregate limits of approximately $25.0 million, and (ii) adverse development coverage (\"ADC\") with remaining aggregate limits of $25.5 million. GLS is asserting that the cedant has committed multiple breaches of the reinsurance agreement, along with other material misrepresentations. Based on these assertions, GLS is seeking full rescission of the reinsurance agreement and related relief, including the ability to recoup losses previously paid, and has denied payment of certain invoices for contractual performance pending the outcome of this arbitration. GLS has previously paid net losses of $10.8 million related to the RPP coverage. GLS has not paid any losses subject to the ADC coverage of the reinsurance agreement in question. As of September 30, 2025, GLS has liabilities of $4.0 million subject to the RPP coverage and $7.5 million in reserves for the ADC coverage. GLS received premiums totaling $9.7 million and $9.8 million for the RPP and ADC coverages, respectively. GLS is vigorously pursuing its claims for rescission and recovery of amounts previously paid. The matter is currently proceeding in arbitration, and an arbitration hearing has now been completed with a decision likely in the first quarter of 2026. The cedant disputes GLS assertions, denying that it breached the agreement, and seeks to continue the contract in full force. The outcome of the arbitration is inherently uncertain. If GLS is successful, it may be entitled to recover up to $10.0 million in losses previously paid and may be relieved of its remaining obligations under the reinsurance agreement in addition to other requested relief. If GLS is unsuccessful, GLS may be required to continue performing under the contract, including potentially paying additional amounts under the RPP coverage, subject to a cap, and being liable for additional amounts under the ADC coverage. The Company's subsidiary Maiden Reinsurance Ltd. has provided a parental guarantee to guarantee the performance and obligations of GLS as finally determined in connection with the arbitration. At this time, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or range of any gain or loss that may result from this matter. Accordingly, no accrual or gain contingency has been recorded in the Company's reserves and other liabilities. An adverse outcome could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. 2 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

If the Company does not qualify for the second compliance period or fails to regain compliance during the second compliance period, then Nasdaq will notify the Company of its determination to delist the Company's ADSs, at which point the Company will have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its ADSs and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options, including, but not limited to, implementing a ratio change of its ADSs, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.

(the \"Company\") and a single institutional and accredited investor (the \"Purchaser\") entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to the Purchaser an aggregate of 9,836,065 shares (the \"Shares\") of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the \"Common Stock\"), or pre-funded warrants exercisable for $0.0001 per share in lieu thereof (\"Pre-Funded Warrants\"), and accompanying common warrants to purchase up to 19,672,130 shares of Common Stock (the \"Warrants\") in a private placement (the \"Offering\"), for gross proceeds of approximately $6 million, before deducting the placement agent's fees and other estimated offering expenses. The purchase price per Share (or Pre-Funded Warrant) and the accompanying Warrants is $0.61. The Warrants will be exercisable immediately following receipt of stockholder approval for the issuance of the Warrants and the shares of Common Stock underlying the Warrants (the \"Warrant Shares,\" and such approval, \"Stockholder Approval\") and have an exercise price of $0.61 per share, subject to adjustment for customary events such as stock splits and fundamental transactions. The Warrants will expire five years from their initial exercise date. At any time following the initial exercise date of the Warrants, the Warrants can be exercised on a cashless basis if there is no effective registration statement registering, or no current prospectus available for, the resale of the Warrant Shares. The Company has agreed to file a registration statement (the \"Registration Statement\") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") covering the resale of the Shares, the shares of Common Stock underling the Pre-Funded Warrants (the \"Pre-Funded Warrant Shares), and the Warrant Shares within 20 calendar days following the closing (the \"Closing\") of the offering contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the \"Offering\") and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC within 60 days following the Closing. The Purchase Agreement also prohibits the Company from, for 90 days following the date the Registration Statement has been declared effective: (a) issuing, entering any agreement to issue or announcing the issuance or proposed issuance of any shares of Common Stock or any Common Stock Equivalents (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) or filing any registration statement other than the Registration Statement contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, or (b) the Company or its Subsidiaries (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) effecting or entering into any agreement to effect the issuance any shares of Common Stock or any Common Stock equivalents involving a Variable Rate Transaction (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). In addition, the Company is required to hold a meeting of stockholders on or prior to the date that is 90 days following the date of Closing to obtain Stockholder Approval, with the recommendation of the board of directors of the Company that such proposals are approved; if the Company does not obtain Stockholder Approval at the first meeting, the Company is required to call a meeting every 90 days thereafter seeking Stockholder Approval until Stockholder Approval is received or the Warrants are no longer outstanding. The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Closing of the Offering is expected to occur on or about December 1, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (the \"Placement Agent\") is acting as the placement agent for the Offering. Pursuant to a placement agent agreement (the \"Placement Agent Agreement\") between the Placement Agent and the Company, dated November 25, 2025, the Company agreed to pay the Placement Agent a cash fee equal to 7% of the aggregate gross proceeds raised in the Offering, and to reimburse the Placement Agent for certain reasonable, documented, and accountable expenses, including legal fees, of $50,000 in the aggregate, and non-accountable expenses of $10,000. In connection with the Closing, each executive officer and director of the Company has agreed to enter into a lock-up agreement with the Placement Agent pursuant to which, from the date of the Closing until 90 days following the date the Registration Statement has been declared effective, such executive officer or director will not offer, sell, contract to sell, hypothecate, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position with respect to, any shares of Common Stock of the Company or securities convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into, shares of Common Stock of the Company beneficially owned, held or hereafter acquired by such executive officer or director, subject to customary exceptions, or make any demand for or exercise any right or cause to be filed a registration statement, including any amendments thereto, with respect to the registration of any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents or publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing.

(the \"Company\") in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, captioned Sonate Corporation, d/b/a Vegadelphia Foods (\"Sonate\") v. Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc., Dunkin' Brands, Inc. (collectively, \"Dunkin'\") and Beyond Meat, Inc., et al., Case No. 6:22-cv-00812. A First Amended Complaint was filed on May 17, 2022 (the \"FAC\"). The FAC alleged that the Company and Dunkin's use of the tagline \"Great Taste Plant-Based,\" infringed on Sonate's registered trademark WHERE GREAT TASTE IS PLANT-BASED (\"Sonate's trademark\"). Additionally, Sonate alleged that the Company's use of the tagline \"Plant-Based Great Taste\" in connection with its own sales of products also infringed on Sonate's trademark. The FAC sought injunctive relief and a monetary award for corrective advertising, a reasonable royalty award, damages representing Sonate's lost sales and the Company's profits generated by the alleged likelihood of confusion, interest, costs, expenses and attorneys' fees. On June 24, 2022, both the Company and Dunkin' filed their answers to the FAC and a motion to change venue. On March 24, 2023, the court issued an order granting Dunkin' and the Company's motion to transfer venue and directed the clerk of the court to transfer the case to the District of Massachusetts, Boston Division for all further proceedings (Case No. 1:23-cv-10690-IT). The Company contended that Sonate will not be able to meet its burden of establishing a likelihood of confusion. Additionally, the Company asserted the fair use defense to Sonate's allegations, namely that the Company's use of \"Plant-Based Great Taste\" and \"Great Taste Plant-Based\" satisfy the requirements of the fair use doctrine (e.g., they are only used descriptively), precluding liability. Mediation was held on September 18, 2024, at which time Dunkin' settled its involvement in the case. On November 20, 2024, Dunkin' was dismissed from the case with prejudice, and the case continued as to the Company. On or about March 11, 2025, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment or adjudication and motions to strike some of Sonate's expert reports and testimony. On or about March 9, 2024, Sonate filed a motion for summary judgment or adjudication and on or about March 11, 2024 filed motions to strike some of the Company's expert reports and testimony. On October 29, 2025, the Court denied Sonate's motion for summary judgment as to issues impacting liability and granted it with respect to a portion of damages relating to the sales made through Dunkin' stores. The Company's motion for summary judgment as to liability for either tagline was denied. As to damages, the Company's motion for summary judgment was granted as to corrective advertising and reasonable royalty damages and denied in part as to lost profits from lost value. The Company's motion to strike was granted as to Sonate's expert report and testimony as to corrective advertising damages, reasonable royalty damages and lost value. Jury trial commenced on November 10, 2025 and concluded on November 24, 2025. The Company's primary general liability insurer has been providing the Company's defense under its primary policy, subject to a reservation of rights. On November 24, 2025, the jury returned its verdict finding that the Company was liable for trademark infringement and that the fair use defense did not apply. The jury awarded damages as follows: $23.5 million in actual damages and $15.4 million in disgorgement of the Company's profits. The Company does not agree with this result and intends to seek further judicial review of the decision and appeal the verdict. Aliments BVeggie, Inc. In November 2023, Aliments BVeggie, Inc. (\"BVeggie\") filed and served legal proceedings against the Company before the Superior Court of Quebec's District of Montreal. BVeggie alleges, among other things that: (i) in 2019, the Company and BVeggie entered into a co-manufacturing agreement, by which BVeggie would produce and deliver products for the benefit of the Company, in exchange for a tolling fee to be paid per pound of product produced and delivered to the Company; (ii) the Company made false and misleading statements regarding the volume of purchase orders it would provide BVeggie; (iii) BVeggie invested significant sums to adapt its facilities for the intended production; (iv) the Company fell short of its undertakings and promises; and (v) in March 2023, the Company illegally terminated the business relationship. BVeggie intends to claim damages in the total amount of 129,841,920 CAD, in compensation for its investments, lost profits and the repairs needed to be made to its facility post-termination of the business relationship and removal of the Company's equipment. The Company intends to vigorously defend against these claims. On December 7, 2023, the Company filed a motion for declinatory exception to stay the proceedings pending before the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal, and refer the dispute to arbitration in California. A hearing on the motion for declinatory exception occurred on April 25, 2024. By judgment dated May 9, 2024, the Superior Court of Quebec granted the motion for declinatory exception filed by the Company and declared that the courts sitting in Los Angeles County, in the State of California, are in a better position to decide the dispute. BVeggie appealed the court's decision on June 7, 2024, and the Company filed a cross-appeal on June 18, 2024. The appeals were heard on October 30, 2025 and by judgment rendered on November 21, 2025, the Court of Appeal has decided to grant the Company's motion for declinatory exception and to defer the dispute to arbitration in California. BVeggie has 60 days from the day of the judgment to file a motion for leave to appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada. In June 2024 and in parallel to the litigation mentioned above, BVeggie filed and served legal proceedings against the Company before the Superior Court of Quebec's District of Montreal, asking that an agreement between the parties by which BVeggie was to purchase certain machinery from the Company, in the amount of $5.1 million, be voided. This litigation is also currently suspended pending the outcome of the aforementioned appeals.

On the Amendment No. 2 Effective Date, $64 million of Term Loans were funded, resulting in $400 million outstanding. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility. The Company expects to use the proceeds from the increased amount of Term Loans outstanding and future borrowings, if any, under the Revolving Facility for general corporate purposes, including funding deferred consideration payments associated with the Company's November 2024 acquisition of Adlumin, Inc., future permitted acquisitions, share repurchases, and related fees and expenses.

During the Corporation's two most recent fiscal years, which ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the subsequent interim period through September 30, 2025, (i) there were no \"disagreements\" (within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) between the Corporation and Salberg on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Salberg's satisfaction, would have caused Salberg to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with their reports; and (ii) there were no \"reportable events\" (within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). In accordance with Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K, the Corporation provided Salberg with a copy of this Current Report on Form 8-K and requested that Salberg furnish the Corporation with a letter addressed to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether Salberg agrees with the above statements of the Corporation herein and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree.

As previously reported, on May 29, 2025, MetaVia Inc.

In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had a period of 180 calendar days from May 29, 2025, or until November 25, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On November 7, 2025, the Company submitted a request to Nasdaq for a 180-day extension to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The Company indicated to Nasdaq that it had demonstrated more than $5 million in stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2025, and provided notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the extended compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary, and in sufficient time to evidence a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days prior to the expiration of the extended compliance period. On June 30, 2025, the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio between 1-for-5 to 1-for-30, with the decision of whether to implement such reverse stock split being subject to the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors. On November 26, 2025, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq advising that the Company had been granted a 180-day extension to May 26, 2026 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). The Company intends to continue actively monitoring the closing bid price for the Company's common stock between now and May 26, 2026, and will consider available options to resolve the deficiency, including effecting a reverse stock split as stated above, and regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If the Company does not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company's common stock will be subject to delisting. The Company would then be entitled to appeal that determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel. There can be no assurance that the Company will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement during this 180-day extension period or maintain compliance with the other Nasdaq listing requirements.

(NYSE: SNV) has received regulatory approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. With shareholders of each company approving the merger on Nov. 6, 2025, Pinnacle and Synovus anticipate completing the merger Jan. 1, 2026, subject to satisfaction of the remaining customary closing conditions. \"Federal bank regulatory approval brings us another step closer to combining two strong organizations with a shared commitment to people,\" said Kevin Blair, Synovus CEO and who will be president and CEO of the combined company. \"By leveraging the best of both firms, we'll accelerate growth, expand opportunities and deliver lasting impact for clients, team members and communities.\" \"I'm incredibly proud of the teams on both sides of this deal who are working in lockstep to bring us together,\" said Pinnacle President and CEO Terry Turner, who will be chairman of the board for post-close Pinnacle. \"This is such a complex process, but both teams are pulling in the same direction toward the end goal, which is to create a bank that's bigger, stronger and better able to serve the needs of our clients and communities than ever before.\" See a complete update of the merger process and a timeline of what's ahead. Integration teams are working closely together toward closing with clear plans for how the firm will operate on Day One, while also building the blueprint for integration. Throughout 2026, team members will work to bring systems, processes and people under the Pinnacle brand. Full system and brand conversions are expected to take place in the first half of 2027. Until then, clients at both firms should see very little change in their day-to-day business, and Synovus locations will continue to operate under the Synovus brand. \"There's no shortage of lessons learned to draw from in a merger like ours, and we've made decisions and taken actions to avoid pitfalls,\" Blair said. \"By focusing on the client and team member experiences and keeping local leadership and continuity across our markets, we're building on Pinnacle's legacy as one of America's top-performing banks with engaged and purposeful teams, a loyal and growing client base and outsized shareholder returns.\" The combined firm will have $116 billion in assets and headquarters in two of the Southeast's most important and fastest growing markets: The holding company will be based in Atlanta, GA, and Pinnacle Bank will be based in Nashville, TN, as a Tennessee state-chartered bank and member of the Federal Reserve System.

The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides that the Term Loans will bear interest, at the Borrower's option, at the rate of (x) the SOFR term rate plus an applicable rate ranging from 0.850% to 1.650% depending on Borrower's credit rating, (y) the SOFR daily simple rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.850% to 1.650% depending on the Borrower's credit rating or (z) the base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.000% to 0.650% depending on the Borrower's credit rating. plus The Company is required to comply with the following financial covenants under the Term Loan Credit Agreement: Ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) to annualized fixed charges not less than 1.15:1.00; Ratio of total unencumbered assets to total unsecured debt not less than 1.25:1.00; and Ratio of Secured Debt (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to the extent there is an equivalent amount of Secured Debt that matures within twenty-four months of such date of determination) to total asset value not to exceed 50%. Ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) to annualized fixed charges not less than 1.15:1.00; Ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) to annualized fixed charges not less than 1.15:1.00; Ratio of total unencumbered assets to total unsecured debt not less than 1.25:1.00; and Ratio of total unencumbered assets to total unsecured debt not less than 1.25:1.00; and Ratio of Secured Debt (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to the extent there is an equivalent amount of Secured Debt that matures within twenty-four months of such date of determination) to total asset value not to exceed 50%. Ratio of Secured Debt (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to the extent there is an equivalent amount of Secured Debt that matures within twenty-four months of such date of determination) to total asset value not to exceed 50%. The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Borrower's ability to (or permit certain subsidiaries to), subject to various exceptions and limitations, incur indebtedness and liens, make investments, pay dividends and enter into certain transactions. A breach of such covenants or any other event of default would entitle the administrative agent to accelerate the Borrower's debt obligations.

The changes to UK online gaming taxation include: Effective from April 2026, iGaming increases 19 percentage points to 40 percent Effective from April 2027, Sports betting (ex-horseracing) increases 10 percentage points to 25 percent The adjusted EBITDA impact of these changes for Flutter, before mitigation, is expected to be approximately $320m in fiscal 2026 and $540m in fiscal 2027 . In the near term, Flutter expects the overall mitigation opportunity to be similar to recent precedent, with a greater relative opportunity for second order mitigation offsetting a moderately lower relative level of first order mitigation. For both Online Sports betting and iGaming tax increases, direct first order mitigation, including reduced operational, promotional and marketing spend is expected to be approximately 20% of the gross impact in the first six months post implementation, rising to approximately 40% thereafter. Given the staggered implementation dates, this would result in the following expected approximate first order mitigation impact by year: In $ millions except where stated otherwise In-year impact Total adjusted EBITDA impact First order mitigation % mitigation Net impact 2027 exit % mitigation These tax increases will have a very significant impact on the overall market. As the largest scale operator, Flutter has the opportunity to deliver material second order mitigation benefits, including market share gains. We believe this, combined with additional operational efficiencies, will provide substantial opportunities to help offset the impact in the medium-term. Kevin Harrington, UKI CEO, commented: \"Today's tax increases are a very disappointing outcome and will have a significant adverse impact on our industry. The Chancellor rightly wants to address harm, but these changes will hand a big win to illegal, unlicensed gambling operators who will become more competitive overnight. These black market operators don't pay tax and don't invest in safer gambling. At 40 percent, the UK's remote gaming duty is now above countries such as the Netherlands, where a recent tax increase saw a rise in illegal gambling and a fall in Government receipts. Despite this impact, I am confident that through both our scale and leading position in the UK, as well as the proactive cost initiatives that we are taking, we are well placed to navigate through today's changes.\" Footnotes Adjusted EBITDA is defined on a Group basis as net income (loss) before income taxes; other income, net; interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; transaction fees and associated costs; restructuring and integration costs; impairment of property and equipment, intangible assets, right-of-use assets and goodwill and share based compensation expense. A reconciliation of our forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure cannot be provided without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the adjusting items necessary for such a reconciliation to be prepared of items that have not yet occurred, are out of our control, or cannot be reasonably predicted The 2026 adjusted EBITDA impact covers the change in online iGaming taxation over the period from April to December 2026 The 2027 adjusted EBITDA impact covers a full year impact of the change in online iGaming taxation and the change in online Sports betting taxation over the period from April to December 2027", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9984356760978699}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9859407544136047}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.7006662487983704}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994556307792664}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9977723956108093}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9983078241348267}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9982335567474365}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.999060332775116}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9978659749031067}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9977912902832031}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9958179593086243}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.997990608215332}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999592125415802}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995736479759216}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992992877960205}], "sentiment": "neutral"}], "overall_sentiment": "neutral", "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": null}, "000119312525300529": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690012/000119312525300529/ck0001690012-20251126.htm", "filing_date": "Wed, 26 Nov 2025 16:14:22 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": true, "ticker": "ICR PR A", "items": {"item 8.01": {"text": "Distribution to Stockholders of Record as of November 30, 2025 The Board of Directors of InPoint Commercial Real Estate Income, Inc.

The Company also announced that it has increased the maximum aggregate principal amount subject to purchase pursuant to the Offer from up to an aggregate principal amount of $50 million to up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $100 million (such increased aggregate principal amount, the \"Tender Cap\"). The Offer is being made exclusively pursuant to an offer to purchase, dated November 12, 2025 (the \"Offer to Purchase\"), as previously amended, which sets forth the terms and conditions of the Offer. As of 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 25, 2025 (the \"Early Tender Deadline\"), $111 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer.

Accordingly, Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline will be subject to proration as described in the Offer to Purchase. The Company will use a proration rate of approximately 90.2% for such Notes and will accept $100 million aggregate principal amount of such Notes for purchase, adjusted for minimum eligible denominations, as permitted by applicable law. The Company expects the settlement of all Notes accepted for purchase to occur on December 1, 2025, subject to all conditions to the Offer having been satisfied or waived. Since the Offer was fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Deadline, the Company will not accept for purchase any Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline.

Brunswick has increased the maximum aggregate principal amount subject to purchase pursuant to the Offer from up to an aggregate principal amount of $50,000,000 to up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $100,000,000 (such increased aggregate principal amount, the \"Tender Cap\"). The following table sets forth some of the terms of the Offer: Title of Security CUSIP Number Principal Amount Outstanding Tender Cap (Principal Amount) Reference U.S. Treasury Security Bloomberg Reference Page Fixed Spread (basis points) Early Tender Premium (per $1,000) Principal Amount Tendered at Early Tender Deadline 5.100% Senior Notes due 2052 117043 AV1 $300,000,000 $100,000,000 4.750% UST due August 15, 2055 175 bps $50.00 $111,327,000 The applicable page on Bloomberg from which the Dealer Manager named below will quote the bid side price of the Reference U.S. Treasury Security (as shown in the table above). In the above table, \"UST\" denotes a U.S. Treasury Security. The Total Consideration (as defined below) for Notes validly tendered (and not subsequently validly withdrawn) prior to or at the Early Tender Deadline (as defined below) and accepted for purchase will be calculated using the fixed spread for the Notes (as specified above) over the yield based on the bid side price of the Reference U.S. Treasury Security (as specified above) and is inclusive of the Early Tender Premium (as defined below). In addition, holders whose Notes are accepted will also receive Accrued Interest (as defined below) on such Notes. The terms and conditions of the Offer are set forth in the offer to purchase, dated November 12, 2025 (the \"Offer to Purchase\"), as amended by this press release. The Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 11, 2025, unless extended by the Company or the Offer has been earlier terminated (the \"Expiration Date\"). No tenders will be valid if submitted after the Expiration Date. As of 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 25, 2025 (the \"Early Tender Deadline\"), according to information provided by D.F. King & Co., Inc., the Information and Tender Agent for the Offer, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes set forth in the table above under \"Principal Amount Tendered at Early Tender Deadline\" had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer. Withdrawal rights for the Notes expired at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 25, 2025. The total consideration (the \"Total Consideration\") paid in the Offer for Notes that were validly tendered and not withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the fixed spread for the Notes specified in the table above plus the yield to maturity of the Reference U.S. Treasury Security specified in the table above and in the Offer to Purchase and will include an early tender premium of $50.00 per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes accepted for purchase (the \"Early Tender Premium\"). Holders of Notes who validly tender their Notes following the Early Tender Deadline and on or prior to the Expiration Date will only receive the applicable \"Tender Offer Consideration\" per $1,000 principal amount of any such Notes tendered by such holders that are accepted for purchase, which is equal to the Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Premium. The Total Consideration will be determined at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on November 26, 2025. The Company will issue a press release specifying the Total Consideration for the Notes expected to be accepted for purchase on November 26, 2025. Only holders of Notes who validly tendered and did not validly withdraw their Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline are eligible to receive the Total Consideration for the Notes accepted for purchase. Holders of Notes will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on their Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from, and including, the most recent interest payment date for the Notes to, but excluding, the settlement date (the \"Accrued Interest\"). Because the aggregate principal amount of all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline exceeds the Tender Cap, the Company will not accept for purchase all of the Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and will only accept for purchase the Notes with an aggregate principal amount equal to the Tender Cap. Accordingly, Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline will be subject to proration as described in the Offer to Purchase. The Company will use a proration rate of approximately 90.2% for such Notes and will accept $100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of such Notes for purchase, adjusted for minimum eligible denominations, as permitted by applicable law. The Company expects the settlement of all Notes accepted for purchase to occur on December 1, 2025, subject to all conditions to the Offer having been satisfied or waived, including the Tender Cap. Since the Offer for the Notes was fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Deadline, the Company will not accept for purchase any Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline.

The board of directors (\"Board\") of Tilray Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\" or \"Tilray\"), approved the implementation of a reverse stock split of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (\"Common Stock\"), at a ratio of one-for-ten (the \"Reverse Stock Split\"), as previously approved at the special meeting of stockholders held on June 10, 2025. The Reverse Stock Split will become legally effective as of 4:01 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on December 1, 2025 (the \"Legal Effective Date\"), and the Common Stock will open for trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Toronto Stock Exchange on a reverse split-adjusted basis on December 2, 2025, under the existing trading symbol \"TLRY\" and with the new CUSIP number of 88688T209 . 88688T209 Reason for the Reverse Stock Split . Reason for the Reverse Stock Split The Company is effectuating the Reverse Stock Split in order to achieve several expected objectives, including (i) aligning Tilray's number of shares outstanding with companies of its size and scope; (ii) making Tilray more attractive to institutional shareholders; and (iii) reducing expenditures associated with Tilray's Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Effects of the Reverse Stock Split. On the Legal Effective Date, every ten shares of the Common Stock issued and outstanding or held as treasury stock will be automatically reclassified into one new share of Common Stock. The par value per share of the Common Stock will remain unchanged at $0.0001 per share. The new CUSIP number for the Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split will be 88688T209 . No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded down to the nearest whole share and stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares that would have been created by the Reverse Stock Split.

(\"Tilray Brands\", \"Tilray\" or \"the Company\") (Nasdaq: TLRY; TSX: TLRY), a global lifestyle and consumer packaged goods company at the forefront of the global cannabis, beverage, and wellness industries, today announced that it will implement a one-for-ten reverse stock split of the Company's common stock (the \"Reverse Stock Split\"), as previously approved at the special meeting of stockholders held on June 10, 2025. The Reverse Stock Split is expected to be effective at 4:01 pm Eastern Time on December 1, 2025 (the \"Effective Date\") and shares of the Company's common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis under the same symbol (TLRY) when the markets open on December 2, 2025, with the new CUSIP number of 88688T209. As previously disclosed, Tilray's stockholders approved, at a special meeting of stockholders held on June 10, 2025, a proposal authorizing an amendment to the Company's Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio within the range of not less than one-for-ten and not more than one-for-twenty, as set by the Board of Directors. The Reverse Stock Split is expected to achieve several objectives, including: Aligning Tilray's number of shares outstanding with companies of similar size and scope; Making Tilray more attractive to institutional shareholders; and Reducing expenditures associated with Tilray's Annual Meeting of Stockholders, resulting in up to $1 million in cost savings on an annual run rate basis. As of the Effective Date, every ten issued and outstanding shares of common stock will be automatically combined and converted into one share, reducing the number of shares of the Company's outstanding common stock from approximately 1.16 billion shares to 116 million shares. Fractional shares will not be issued. Instead, stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares that would have been created by the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split is not expected to affect any stockholder's ownership percentage of the Company's common stock, except to the extent that it would result in any stockholder owning a fractional share. Pacific Stock Transfer will act as the paying agent for the Reverse Stock Split and will provide stockholders with a transaction statement that reflects their post-split shareholdings. Stockholders owning shares via a broker, bank, trust or other similar organization will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split, subject to such organization's particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.

All other terms and conditions of the Rights Plan remain unchanged. The Board adopted the Rights Plan to protect the investment of shareholders during a period in which it believes shares of the Company do not reflect the inherent value of the business or its long-term growth potential, and during which there have been recent significant accumulations of Company common stock by certain shareholders. In adopting the extension of the Rights Plan, the Board reiterated its belief that shares of the Company continue to not reflect the inherent value of the business or its long-term growth potential and that the Company remains vulnerable to the acquisition of actual or de facto control by one or more shareholders without paying a control premium to other shareholders. The Rights Plan is not intended to interfere with any sale, merger, tender, exchange offer, or other business combination approved by the Board. Nor does the Rights Plan prevent the Board from considering any offer that recognizes the full value of PetMeds and is in the best interests of PetMeds' shareholders. Rather, the Rights Plan is intended to enable the Company's shareholders to realize the long-term value of their investment, ensure that all shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company, and to guard against tactics to gain control of the Company without paying all shareholders an appropriate premium for that control. The amendment to the Rights Plan extends the expiration date of the Rights by one year. Unless earlier redeemed, terminated, or exchanged pursuant to the Rights Plan, the Rights will expire at the close of business on December 2, 2026. Further details about the amendment to the Rights Plan will be contained in a Form 8-K to be filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").

(NASDAQ: PXLW) (\"Pixelworks\" or the \"Company\"), a leading provider of innovative video and display processing solutions, today announced that its Special Meeting of Stockholders held on November 26, 2025 (the \"Special Meeting\") has been adjourned until December 8, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific time to give shareholders additional time to vote on Proposal 1. Proposal 1 would authorize the sale of all the shares of the Company's subsidiary, Pixelworks Semiconductor Technology (Shanghai), held indirectly by the Company (the \"Sale\"). Although the proposal has received significant support based on the shares that had been voted by November 26, 2025, the requisite approval by holders of at least 67% of the outstanding shares of common stock on the record date for the special meeting has not yet been received for Proposal 1. When the Special Meeting was convened, approximately 98% of the shares that had been voted on Proposal 1 were voted in its favor but represented only approximately 57% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the record date for the Special Meeting. The Board of Directors continues to believe that the approval of Proposal 1 is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and both leading independent proxy voting advisory groups, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, recommended that shareholders vote FOR Proposal 1. Proposal 1 is described in more detail in the proxy statement filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 2025 (the \"Special Meeting Proxy Statement\"), as supplemented by additional definitive proxy materials filed by the Company on November 4, 2025. Adjournment of Special Meeting The adjourned Special Meeting will be held in a virtual format and shareholders of record on October 17, 2025, will be able to listen and participate in the reconvened meeting, as well as vote and submit questions during the meeting by dialing 1-888-788-0099. The conference ID number for the Special Meeting is 85737219104. The Company's Board of Directors encourages any shareholder as of the record date of October 17, 2025, who has not yet voted their shares on Proposal 1 or is uncertain if their shares have been voted on Proposal 1 to contact their broker or bank to vote their shares as soon as possible, but no later than December 7, 2025, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time. Stockholders who have previously submitted their proxy or otherwise voted on Proposal One at the Special Meeting of Shareholders and who do not wish to change their vote need not take any action. For questions relating to the voting of shares or to request additional or misplaced proxy voting materials, please contact the Company's proxy solicitor, Alliance Advisors, for assistance in voting your shares toll free (in the U.S.) at 1-855-206-1342 or via email at PXLW@allianceadvisors.com.

The dispute relates to the 2014 Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement (the \"Collaboration Agreement\" (Ex. 1)1) between AnaptysBio and Tesaro, which gave Tesaro rights to AnaptysBio's promising PD-1 antagonist (\"PD-1\"), dostarlimab, which is now sold under the brand name Jemperli. Based on results from head-to-head clinical studies, dostarlimab is potentially a best-in- class PD-1 therapy to treat various cancers. 4. In the Collaboration Agreement, AnaptysBio obtained assurances that Tesaro would advance dostarlimab. These assurances manifested in an exclusivity obligationTesaro agreed it would not participate in developing other PD-1s and a stringent diligence requirementTesaro must use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the \"optimum\" commercial return for dostarlimab in all major markets of the world. 5. In 2020, after GSK acquired Tesaro, Tesaro and GSK decided to ignore these duties and conduct a clinical trial with their product Zejula (niraparib) in combination with Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V.'s (\"Merck\") Keytruda (pembrolizumab). Keytruda is dostarlimab's most formidable PD-1 competitor. 1 Attached as Exhibit 2 to the Complaint is Amendment Number Three to the Collaboration Agreement, dated October 23, 2020 (\"the Amendment\"). AnaptysBio has intentionally omitted the Second and Fifth Amendments because they are not relevant to the current dispute. 3 6. Tesaro and GSK knew that this trial breached the Collaboration Agreement. Not only did the exclusivity and diligence provisions plainly prohibit it, but AnaptysBio had also expressly rejected an earlier Tesaro request to conduct a similar clinical trial. 7. As a result, AnaptysBio was forced to bring suit in this Court for Tesaro's breach of contract and GSK's tortious interference in August 2020. GSK and Tesaro recognized their errorthey hurried to the bargaining table, agreeing to pay AnaptysBio $60 million upfront, a royalty on Zejula, and to more than double the royalty payments on dostarlimab to settle the dispute. (See Ex. 3, Confidential Settlement and Modification Agreement, dated October 23, 2020 (\"the Settlement Agreement\").) 8. AnaptysBio hoped that Tesaro would not flout its duties again. But to further protect its rights and interests, AnaptysBio bargained for and received additional protections as part of the settlement by amending the Collaboration Agreement. (Ex. 2.) The Amendment increased Tesaro's duties to inform and update AnaptysBio about dostarlimab development and commercialization efforts, and generally precluded Tesaro from licensing or otherwise providing GSK with dostarlimab rights. 4 9. AnaptysBio recently discovered, however, that Tesaro flouted its duties again. And this time, Tesaro repeatedly withheld material information to hide its breaches. 10. In fact, Tesaro breached its obligations the moment the ink dried on the prior settlement. As part of the settlement, Tesaro was required to disclose clinical trials that GSK and Tesaro \"plan to conduct or are currently conducting involving dostarlimab.\" Yet Tesaro never disclosed a clinical trial that was ongoing at the time, the I-SPY Trial, which involved dostarlimab and competitor PD-1s. 11. Tesaro's breaches have continued since then. In a repeat of the 2020 dispute, where Tesaro and GSK sought to support Zejula at dostarlimab's expense, Tesaro and GSK have recently focused on conducting clinical trials to maximize the market for antibody-drug conjugates (\"ADCs\") that GSK committed billions to buy.2 These ADCs may be particularly advantageous when combined with PD-1s like dostarlimab to kill cancer cells. Yet Tesaro has not sought to optimize dostarlimab's commercial opportunity as required, and has instead 2 E.g., GSK, \"GSK enters exclusive license agreement with Hansoh for HS-20089\" (2023) GSK plc., available at: https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk- enters-exclusive-license-agreement-with-hansoh-for-hs-20089/ (last accessed on November 20, 2025). see also GSK, \"GSK acquires exclusive rights from Syndivia for antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in prostate cancer\" (2025) GSK plc., available at: https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-acquires-exclusive-rights-from- syndivia-for-antibody-drug-conjugate/ (last accessed on November 20, 2025). 5 allowed GSK to maximize the opportunity for the ADCs through clinical trials that pair the ADCs with PD-1s that compete with dostarlimab, violating the Collaboration Agreement. 12. There is no excuse for Tesaro's and GSK's conduct: they control whether dostarlimab's competitors are included in their clinical trials. They also control the study design and could have designed studies to obtain dostarlimab's optimum commercial return, as Tesaro is obligated to do, when paired with these ADCs. Similarly situated companies, particularly competitors like Merck and AstraZeneca, with PD-1 antagonists have done exactly that: they design clinical trials to optimize the commercial return for two of their products in a combination therapy context. And, on information and belief, that is precisely what GSK and Tesaro themselves have done in other contexts not involving dostarlimab. 13. But that is not what Tesaro has done here, and the reason is plain. Tesaro acts at GSK's behest and GSK has chosen to prioritize its ADC programs, regardless of the detrimental effect on dostarlimab, thus inducing Tesaro's breaches. 14. Tesaro cannot pick and choose which Collaboration Agreement provisions it will follow based on its appetite for compliance and pressure from GSK. Nor does the Collaboration Agreement give Tesaro wiggle room to elevate its and GSK's commercial interests at dostarlimab's direct expense. Quite the 6 opposite: Tesaro is duty-bound to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the \"optimum\" commercial return for dostarlimab. 15. The Collaboration Agreement provides an important remedy when Tesaro violates the commercially reasonable efforts duty or otherwise materially breaches: the rights to dostarlimab revert to AnaptysBio within 60 days of notice of material breach. AnaptysBio brings this action to obtain a declaration that it is entitled to that remedy and obtain all other appropriate relief. THE PARTIES 16. AnaptysBio is a Delaware corporation having its principal place of business at 10770 Wateridge Circle, Suite 210, San Diego, CA 92121. 17. On information and belief, Tesaro, Inc. is a Delaware corporation having its principal place of business at 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808. On information and belief, Tesaro, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of defendant GSK. 18. On information and belief, GSK is a Delaware LLC having its principal place of business at 5 Crescent Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19112. 19. On information and belief, GSK has the power to control and direct, and does control and direct, Tesaro's actions, including the misconduct alleged in this complaint. 7 20. On information and belief, Tesaro is financially dependent on GSK, and Tesaro does not have adequate capital without GSK to satisfy its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, including its obligation to develop and commercialize dostarlimab consistent with its commercially reasonable efforts duties. 21. On information and belief, Tesaro either has no bank account or the bank account it has is controlled by GSK. When AnaptysBio is owed money under the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro's required payments are made from a GSK bank account. 22. On information and belief, Tesaro has no employees, and individuals who hold titles with Tesaro are in fact employed by GSK. 23. GSK has assumed all Tesaro's obligations under the Collaboration Agreement and confirmed publicly and to AnapytsBio that it has taken over responsibility for dostarlimab's development and commercialization. JURISDICTION 24. This Court is vested with jurisdiction to adjudicate this action under 10 Del. C. 341. 25. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Tesaro and GSK under 8 Del. C. 321 because they are Delaware business entities. 8 26. Tesaro and GSK have also consented to this Court's personal and subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to an agreement with AnaptysBio. FACTUAL BACKGROUND I. AnaptysBio Develops Lifesaving Medicines 27. AnaptysBio is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on delivering innovative therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 28. AnaptysBio has also discovered and out-licensed, in financial collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies, multiple therapeutic antibodies, including cancer therapies such as dostarlimab, developed using a proprietary antibody discovery technology platform. These collaborations allow AnaptysBio's partners to advance drug candidates clinically and commercially while AnaptysBio retains certain rights, including rights to milestone and royalty payments. II. Tesaro's Obligations Under the Collaboration Agreement 29. On March 10, 2014, AnaptysBio and Tesaro entered into the Collaboration Agreement, which is governed by Delaware law. (Ex. 1 15.1.) The Collaboration Agreement has been amended five times, including the Amendment in October 2020 to settle the previous dispute between the parties. (Ex. 2.) The Collaboration Agreement's purpose is to allow the parties to work together to develop life-saving medicines, including cancer treatments like PD-1s. 9 30. The Collaboration Agreement has an exclusivity provision that forbids Tesaro from researching or developing therapeutics that might compete with AnaptysBio's. Setting aside dostarlimab and Zejula (referred to as \"niraparib\" in the Amendment), Tesaro shall \"not knowingly conduct, participate in, license or fund, directly or indirectly, alone or with any Affiliate or Third Party, research or development with respect to, or manufacturing or commercialization of, a Target Antagonist [e.g., PD-1.]\" (Ex. 2 5.3(b).) 31. The exclusivity provision has a limited carveout, added in the Amendment, for (1) combination studies (i.e., when the medicinal products are administered together) that involve Target Antagonists combined with either Zejula or dostarlimab and (2) studies where the same patient otherwise receives both a Target Antagonist and Zejula or dostarlimab (e.g., when the medicinal products are administered separately, such as in separate doses). The Collaboration Agreement, as amended, says: For the sake of clarity, any research, development, manufacturing, and/or commercialization by Tesaro and/or its affiliates of a Target Antagonist that is not a Product in combination with or otherwise with respect to [Zejula] or a Product is permitted under the Agreement. (Ex. 2 5.3(b).) 32. \"Target Antagonist\" means \"an antibody that is created against and selected in order to antagonize Target(s), and does antagonize that Target.\" (Ex. 1 10 1.42.) Examples of Target Antagonists include anti-PD-1 antibodies, including Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab), cemiplimab, rilvegostomig, and durvalumab. 33. \"Target(s)\" under the Collaboration Agreement means \"LAG-3, PD-1 and TIM-3.\" (Ex. 1 1.41.) \"LAG-3\" means \"lymphocyte-activation gene 3, encoded by the LAG3 gene, also known as CD223.\" (Id. 1.25.) \"PD-1\" means \"programmed cell death protein 1, encoded by the PDCD1 gene, also known as CD279.\" (Id. 1.33.) And \"TIM-3\" means \"the T cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein 3 protein, encoded by the TIM3 gene.\" (Id. 1.46.) LAG-3, PD-1, and TIM-3 play a role in cancer growth and antagonizing them may inhibit that growth. 34. The Amendment notes that the exclusivity provision generally does not apply to Tesaro's parents and their Affiliates. (Ex. 2 5.3(e).) But to prevent Tesaro from trying to circumvent its duties by working through GSK and GSK Affiliates, the Amendment prohibits Tesaro from \"assign[ing], licens[ing], or otherwise transfer[ing] its intellectual property rights granted by AnaptysBio in respect of the Products . . . to GSK or any GSK Affiliates.\" (Id.) 35. Although Tesaro can engage Affiliates or third-party Subcontractors to provide it with services or to develop and commercialize dostarlimab, any subcontract must require the contracting entity to \"accept[] and compl[y]\" with all Collaboration Agreement terms. (Ex. 1 2.11(b).). The arrangement must \"be in 11 writing,\" \"impose on [the contracting party] all applicable obligations under the terms of [the Collaboration] Agreement,\" \"contain terms and conditions which are consistent with the [Collaboration Agreement's] terms and conditions,\" and cannot \"in any way diminish, reduce or eliminate any of Tesaro's obligations[,]\" including the exclusivity and diligence duties. (Id.) 36. Even without Section 2.11(b), the diligence provision described below forbids Tesaro from engaging Affiliates or Subcontractors who undertake activities that would not allow dostarlimab to achieve its optimum commercial return. 37. The diligence provision requires Tesaro to \"use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to . . . commercialize Products [e.g., dostarlimab] and attempt to obtain the optimum commercial return for each Product in all major markets throughout the world.\" (Id. 8.1(e).) This obligation was not modified in the Amendment. 38. The diligence duty in Section 8.1(e) helps ensure that AnaptysBio is appropriately compensated for discovering dostarlimab and licensing it to Tesaro. AnaptysBio receives tiered royalty payments based on dostarlimab sales, with the royalty rate ranging from eight percent to twenty-five percent. (Ex. 2 1.4.) AnaptysBio's entitlement to these payments is tied, in part, to the expiration of dostarlimab-related patents. (Ex. 1 6.4(b); id. 1.4, 1.8.) Tesaro is responsible for prosecuting dostarlimab-related patents. (Ex. 4, Amendment No. 4 to the 12 Collaboration Agreement, dated Oct. 21, 2021.) In turn, Tesaro's efforts related to the prosecution of patents stemming from the collaboration relate to whether it has acted in a commercially reasonable manner to obtain dostarlimab's optimum commercial return. 39. To help ensure that Tesaro satisfies its obligations, Tesaro must keep AnaptysBio apprised of its efforts to develop and commercialize dostarlimab. Tesaro must use \"Commercially Reasonable Efforts to disclose to AnaptysBio all material information relating to the applicable Development Program\"such as development related to dostarlimab\"promptly after it is learned or its materiality is appreciated.\" (Ex. 1. 3.2(b).) Further, \"[w]ithin sixty (60) days following the end of each calendar quarter of the Development Program, Tesaro shall provide AnaptysBio with a reasonably detailed written report describing the progress to date of all activities during such quarter under the applicable Development Program and the activities planned through the following two (2) quarters.\" (Id.) 40. These information reporting duties are central to the parties' bargain. It is, at best, impractical for a startup biotech company like AnaptysBio to monitor Tesaro's and GSK's direct or indirect participation in clinical trials: on information and belief, there are over 500,000 clinical trials registered globally on any given day. And not every entity participating is publicly disclosed. In fact, sometimes the drugs involved in the study are not specifically disclosed. GSK itself has 13 ambiguously referred to dostarlimab as simply an \"anti-cancer therapy\" in at least one clinical trial. So, without complete disclosure about Tesaro's efforts, AnaptysBio is hamstrung in its ability to ensure dostarlimab is progressing to achieve its optimum commercial return. And AnaptysBio cannot timely exercise one of its most important rightsseeking dostarlimab's reversionif it lacks full information. 41. The disclosure duties are so key that AnaptysBio required that they be strengthened through the Amendment. The Amendment required that the parties establish a new Joint Review Committee (\"JRC\") to ensure that Tesaro would notify AnaptysBio about dostarlimab-related development and commercialization activities on a recurring, regular basis. (Ex. 2 4.6(b)(i)-(iii).) Tesaro must notify AnaptysBio about all \"future activities planned by\" Tesaro or any Tesaro Affiliates (e.g., GSK) regarding \"preclinical, clinical, and commercial advancement of\" dostarlimab. (Id. 4.6(b)(i).) The Amendment also requires Tesaro to provide updates about clinical trials involving dostarlimab and dostarlimab's commercialization. (Id. 4.6(b)(ii-iii).) 42. The Amendment also required that Tesaro disclose all clinical trials that Tesaro or GSK planned to conduct or were conducting involving dostarlimab in an exhibit. (Id. 8.1.) If Tesaro failed to disclose any such trial, the rights to dostarlimab revert to AnaptysBio. (Id.; Ex. 1 8.2.) 14 43. The Collaboration Agreement explains what happens when Tesaro breaches its duties in other ways as well. If Tesaro breaches its diligence duties under Section 8.1, then \"all rights to\" the relevant Development Program \"shall revert to AnaptysBio . . . .\" (Ex. 1 8.2.) 44. For other material breaches, the Collaboration Agreement allows the non-breaching party to terminate the entire agreement. (Id. 14.2.) 45. But termination is not the only remedy available. The Collaboration Agreement provides that \"[t]ermination is not the sole remedy under this Agreement, and whether or not termination is effected, all other remedies will remain available except as agreed to otherwise herein.\" (Id. 14.7.) III. The Collaboration Agreement Leads to Dostarlimab's Development and Approval 46. AnaptysBio's collaboration with Tesaro resulted in dostarlimab's development: AnaptysBio discovered it using its proprietary technology and Tesaro was, and continues to be, responsible for its development and commercialization. 47. Dostarlimab is a \"Product\" under the Collaboration Agreement. 48. Dostarlimab received FDA regulatory approval to treat a certain subset of recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer in April 2021 and to treat a certain subset of advanced solid tumors in August 2021. Dostarlimab was approved for the frontline treatment of a subset of patients with advanced or 15 recurrent endometrial cancer in July 2023, and the entirety of this population in August 2024. Dostarlimab also shows promise for treating several other types of cancer. 49. For now, however, Merck's Keytruda remains the market leader and clinical trials that aim to benefit it or other competing PD-1s can impair dostarlimab's optimum commercial return today and in the future. IV. Soon After the Collaboration Agreement is Signed, Tesaro Seeks to Violate the Agreement by Developing Competitor PD-1s 50. In 2015, Tesaro sought AnaptysBio's permission to conduct an early- stage clinical trial with Zejula in combination with Merck's Keytruda. 51. After considerable negotiations, AnaptysBio gave Tesaro a limited waiver to conduct this specific trial. But AnaptysBio made clear that its consent for this trial \"will not be deemed to give a waiver or consent . . . for any other study that may be the same or similar[.]\" 52. Later, Tesaro sought to expand the waiver to allow for additional combination product trials involving Zejula and Keytruda. 53. AnaptysBio declined, reiterating that PD-1 exclusivity was a critical component of the Collaboration Agreement: \"Per our prior conversations, mutual exclusivity was a key tenet of our partnership from the very outset. AnaptysBio accepted the financial terms of our partnership, and agreed to be exclusive to TESARO in that we would forego any other opportunities to discover, develop and 16 commercialize PD-1 . . . antibodies outside of the TESARO relationship[.] . . . Waiving exclusivity at this point, particularly in the combination therapy setting where PD-1 antibodies hold the greatest commercial promise, would lead to a material reduction in the financial return to AnaptysBio.\" V. GSK Acquires Tesaro in 2019, and They Plan Clinical Trials that Violate the Exclusivity and Diligence Provisions 54. On information and belief, in April 2014, GSK's parent company GlaxoSmithKline plcsold its oncology portfolio and research and development activities valued at approximately $16 billion to Novartis and announced that it was leaving the oncology field.3 55. In January 2019, GSK acquired Tesaro for $5.1 billion. With that acquisition, GSK, along with its corporate affiliates, re-entered the oncology space.4 56. GSK knows about Tesaro's contractual obligations to AnaptysBio, including the exclusivity and diligence obligations, because it owns and controls Tesaro and was a co-defendant in the previous litigation. GSK also knows about AnaptysBio's limited waiver with respect to a single clinical trial, and 3 H. Plumridge, \"Glaxo Exits Cancer Drugs\" (2014) The Wall Street Journal, /Archives/edgar/data/1370053/000137005321000019/anab- confidentialsettlemen.htm (last accessed November 20, 2025). 6 Id. 19 major markets; and Tesaro is still required to provide AnaptysBio with information about its efforts to comply with the Collaboration Agreement. 63. The Amendment also gave AnaptysBio more protection. The notice obligations were enhanced through the JRC. (Ex. 2 4.6(b)(i)-(iii).) Tesaro had to identify all dostarlimab clinical trials that it or GSK were conducting or planning to conduct in an exhibit to the Amendment. (Id. 8.1.) This duty was so important to AnaptysBio that rights to dostarlimab revert if it is breached. (Ex. 1 8.1; Ex. 2 8.2.) Finally, Tesaro is generally forbidden from transferring dostarlimab intellectual property rights granted by AnaptysBio to GSK. (Ex. 2 5.3(e).) VI. GSK Absorbs Tesaro and Announces its Responsibility for All Tesaro's Obligations Under the Collaboration Agreement 64. After the October 2020 settlement, GSK began dominating and controlling Tesaro. 65. To start, Tesaro presently has no formal web presence of its own; the web address www.tesarobio.com links to GSK's website. Tesaro last made an SEC filing in 2019, and a GSK Annual Report lists Tesaro, Inc.'s headquarters as the address of an entity-management and registered-agent service in Delaware and Tesaro Development, Ltd.'s as an entity-management service in Bermuda meaning that neither have formal operations of their own. On information and belief, Tesaro has no physical office, no employees, and no longer maintains 20 distinct corporate officers or directors. On information and belief, anyone who holds a title with Tesaro, Inc. or Tesaro Development, Ltd. is employed and paid by GSK. 66. That GSK dominates and controls Tesaro with respect to dostarlimab and the AnaptysBio relationship is reaffirmed by the fact that GSK employees, not Tesaro employees, attend all JRC meetings related to dostarlimab. The JRC members and meeting participants from 2022 to present are identified in JRC documents as GSK employees. Further, the JRC meeting slides and quarterly royalty reports are stamped with GSK's logonot Tesaro's. Virtually every communication to AnaptysBio regarding the Collaboration Agreement since the October 2020 settlement has come from GSK. Indeed, GSK employees negotiated and executed the Amendment and Settlement Agreement on both Tesaro's and GSK's behalf. And when AnaptysBio is entitled to payments from Tesaro stemming from the Collaboration Agreement, the payments come from GSK's bank accounts. 67. GSK has also announced to AnaptysBio and to the world that it is responsible for Tesaro's \"research, development, commercialisation, and manufacturing\" obligations related to dostarlimab.7 In fact, GSK has confirmed 7 GSK, \"Jemperli (dostarlimab) receives US FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for locally advanced dMMR/MSI-H rectal cancer\" (2024) GSK, available at: 21 that it is responsible for dostarlimab's development in SEC filings dating back to 2021. Consistent with those representations, GSK has also disclosed in SEC filings that GSK is initiating dostarlimab clinical trials.8 That makes sense because for every dostarlimab clinical trial that has been disclosed to AnaptysBio under the Collaboration Agreement, GSK is either the sponsor or the collaborator. 68. GSK's representations to AnaptysBio are consistent with those public announcements: during JRC meetings, GSK has referred to clinical trials involving AnaptysBio Products as \"sponsored by GSK.\" VII. Tesaro's Breaches of the Collaboration Agreement and GSK's Inducement of those Breaches 69. Since AnaptysBio and Tesaro signed the Amendment through about late July 2025, AnaptysBio had no inkling that Tesaro was breaching, and GSK was inducing Tesaro to breach, the Collaboration Agreement. But Tesaro and GSK were misleading AnaptysBio this entire time in contractually required information reports and JRC meetings to prevent AnaptysBio from discovering the truth. https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/jemperli-dostarlimab-receives-us-fda- breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-locally-advanced-dmmrmsi-h-rectal-cancer/ (last accessed on November 20, 8 GlaxoSmithKline plc Form 6-K (April 22, 2021) at 3; GlaxoSmithKline plc Form 6-K (June 14, 2021) at 2-3; GlaxoSmithKline plc Form 6-K (February 9, 2023) at 2. 22 A. Tesaro's Participation in, and Failure to Disclose, the I-SPY Trial in the Amendment Breaches the Collaboration Agreement 70. AnaptysBio has discovered that, by September 8, 2020, while the parties were negotiating the settlement of their prior dispute, GSK had committed to providing \"TSR-042\"a Tesaro identifier for dostarlimabin a trial known as the I-SPY Trial. On information and belief, Tesaro and GSK's governance committee approved providing dostarlimab for the study and thus it was also approved to help conduct the study. That trial includes not only dostarlimab, but a host of other PD-1s that Tesaro is forbidden from participating in researching or developing, including Keytruda, Libtayo (cemiplimab), AZD2936 (rilvegostomig), and Imfinzi (durvalumab). The trial also includes a LAG-3 antagonist, REGN3767, that Tesaro was prohibited from participating in the research or development of at the time as well. 71. Tesaro at least indirectly participated in this trial in violation of Section 5.3(b) by providing dostarlimab or dostarlimab-related intellectual property to GSK for the trial. 72. Tesaro was required to disclose the I-SPY Trial in the Amendment but omitted it instead. And, on information and belief, GSK caused or induced Tesaro to omit this trial from Exhibit D to the Amendment. (Ex. 2 8.1; id. Ex. D.) 73. Just as bad, the Amendment forbids Tesaro from assigning, licensing, or otherwise transferring dostarlimab rights to GSKbut it was GSK who 23 committed to providing \"TSR-042\" (dostarlimab) for the I-SPY Trial.9 GSK could not have provided dostarlimab for this study without receiving it or rights to it from Tesaro. Indeed, dostarlimab had not received regulatory approval at the time so it was not available for purchase on the open market. Tesaro's conduct, induced by GSK, violates Section 5.3(e). 74. Tesaro's omission of the study, as well as GSK's inducement of that omission, breaches Section 8.1, which triggers AnaptysBio's reversion rights under Section 8.2. 75. Tesaro has continued its breaches of the exclusivity, diligence, licensing, and notice duties in connection with the I-SPY Trial. GSK has facilitated these breaches. 76. In July 2025, for example, it was publicly announced that the I-SPY Trial would include a third dostarlimab arm that also includes one of GSK's ADCs. This arm is part of Tesaro's and GSK's efforts, described below, to favor the development of GSK's ADCs. Tesaro's participation is clear: it is providing dostarlimab for the trial, so it is not only violating the exclusivity provision but 9 FirstWordPharma, \"Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative and Athenex Announce the Selection of Oral Paclitaxel plus Encequidar in Combination with dostarlimab, an anti-PD-1, in the I-SPY 2 TRIAL targeting Stage 2/3 HER2+ and HER2- Breast Cancers\" (2020), available at: https://firstwordpharma.com/story/5101197 (last accessed on November 20, 2025). 24 also the licensing restriction. GSK's participation is also clear, so its inducement of these breaches is equally clear: the GSK ADC used in trial lacks regulatory approval so it cannot be purchased on the open market. B. Tesaro's Participation in Clinical Trials Designed to Support GSK's Recently Acquired ADC Program Breaches the Collaboration Agreement 77. Since 2023, GSK has started betting big on ADCs. In October 2023, GSK acquired the rights to an ADC developed by Hansoh Pharma (\"Hansoh\"). GSK agreed to pay $85 million upfront and up to $1.485 billion in success-based milestones for exclusive rights (outside of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) to them. About two months later, GSK and Hansoh inked a second deal that gave GSK rights to a different Hansoh ADC. This time GSK paid $185 million upfront and up to $1.525 billion in success-based milestones. And just this year, GSK bought another ADC from French biotech company Syndivia for over $355 million, including success-based milestones. 78. Tesaro and GSK have, on information and belief, made GSK's ADC programs a top priority. Much like they did in 2020 with Zejula, GSK's development program for their ADC portfolio is being favored by Tesaro and GSK to dostarlimab's detriment. Tesaro and GSK have conducted, participated in, licensed, funded, or governed a series of clinical trials with dostarlimab competitors to benefit GSK's ADCs and their market potentialeven if it means 25 hurting dostarlimab's. These studies are not designed in accord with an objective to obtain dostarlimab's \"optimum\" commercial return: conducting clinical trials with competitor drugs can yield data that benefits GSK's ADCs and those competitors, but at dostarlimab's expense. 79. These trials, as further explained below, alone and together through the overall plan to prioritize GSK's ADCs, even if it means undermining dostarlimab's commercial position, breach the Collaboration Agreement in multiple material ways. 80. First, Tesaro has breached, and GSK induced Tesaro to breach, the Collaboration Agreement in connection with a study called BEHOLD EC-02 in endometrial cancer. This forthcoming Phase 3 trial will study a GSK ADC in combination with Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) or dostarlimab. Tesaro did not timely inform AnaptysBio about this study as Sections 3.2 and 4.6 require, as the study had already been designed and \"governed\" as approved by GSK when it was disclosed to AnaptysBio in late July 2025. This study also breaches the licensing provision in Section 5.3(e) and the exclusivity provision in Section 5.3(b) because Tesaro is not only participating but also providing dostarlimab or dostarlimab rights to GSK for the trial. It also violates the commercially reasonable efforts duty in Section 8.1 because it can directly benefit a dostarlimab competitor. In fact, the way the trial is designed, the Keytruda data generated can hurt 26 dostarlimab's commercial returneven though there are well-known and accepted steps that pharmaceutical companies take, and Tesaro should have required GSK to taketo avoid such outcomes. 81. Second, it is plain that GSK seeks to promote its ADCs in combination with PD-1s other than dostarlimab. For example, GSK ran Clinical Trial No. NCT06551142, which began around August 9, 2024 and studies the safety of one of GSK's ADCs when administered with other anticancer agents, including multiple prohibited PD-1s such as Keytruda and durvalumab. But dostarlimab is not included. 82. On information and belief, Tesaro is aware of GSK's plans for its ADCs at least because Tesaro is actively involved in studies of GSK's ADCs with dostarlimab, including the forthcoming BEHOLD EC-02 study described above and the on-going BEHOLD-2 study described below. 83. Conducting clinical trials with dostarlimab competitors can undermine dostarlimab's commercial return, as a study like Clinical Trial No. NCT06551142 is an initial step toward FDA approval of combination therapies of GSK's ADCs with PD-1s competitive to dostarlimab. 84. However, on information and belief, Tesaro has not stopped GSK from running studies with competitive PD-1s, nor even asked GSK to stop. 27 85. It is, and was, commercially unreasonable for Tesaro to cede, and continue to cede, dostarlimab development and commercialization activities to GSK, who is actively conducting trials that frustrate dostarlimab's commercial prospects, and for Tesaro to facilitate rather that halt these activities. At minimum, these actions do not seek to obtain dostarlimab's optimum commercial return. 86. Further, GSK's overall clinical trial strategy for its ADCs appears focused on establishing that GSK's ADCs work with any PD-1 (not just dostarlimab). In other words, Tesaro and GSK are agnostic as to whether these trials will benefit or harm dostarlimab so long as the market for GSK's ADCs is improved. But that is contrary to the required objective of obtaining dostarlimab's optimum commercial return and thus violates the diligence provision. Indeed, participating in clinical trials that seek to benefit dostarlimab's direct competitors is inconsistent with achieving dostarlimab's optimum commercial return because those trials can impair dostarlimab's current market position or future growth in both approved indications or where dostarlimab could otherwise have been developed in combination with GSK's ADCs (rather than dostarlimab's competitors combined with GSK's ADCs). 87. Just as bad, Tesaro has breached its diligence duties by failing to seek future regulatory approval for dostarlimab as a monotherapy or combination therapy in additional indications, like small cell lung cancer. Tesaro and GSK have 28 publicly stated that they are excited about data generated with GSK's ADCs and a PD(L)-1 antagonist to treat small cell lung cancer, but they are not pursuing dostarlimab in this context. Achieving regulatory approval for dostarlimab in additional indications can enhance its commercial prospects, so Tesaro's failure to pursue that objective in this context violates the duty to seek dostarlimab's optimum commercial return. 88. On information and belief, Tesaro and GSK have or had multiple anti- cancer therapies or other therapeutics that are or were similar to dostarlimab from scientific, regulatory, intellectual property, and profitability perspectives. Further, on information and belief, the efforts that Tesaro and GSK expended to obtain the optimum commercial return for those therapeutics are inconsistent with the efforts that they have undertaken regarding dostarlimab. 89. By way of example only, Tesaro's and GSK's conduct regarding dostarlimab is inconsistent with their conduct related to their anti-cancer therapy, Zejula. Both dostarlimab (Jemperli) and Zejula are FDA-approved anti-cancer therapies and both have significant commercial sales. On information and belief, however, neither Tesaro nor GSK has sponsored clinical trials with Zejula's competitors, such as Merck and AstraZeneca's Lynparza (olaparib). On information and belief, Tesaro and GSK do not sponsor clinical trials with Lynparza because they know it could hurt Zejula's optimum commercial return. 29 90. As another example, Tesaro's and GSK's conduct regarding dostarlimab is also inconsistent with their conduct related to GSK's ADCs. For example, on information and belief, neither Tesaro nor GSK has sponsored clinical trials with Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca's ADCs Enhertu and Datroway. Enhertu and Datroway are ADCs that have received regulatory approval to treat certain cancers and have significant commercial sales. On information and belief, Tesaro and GSK do not sponsor trials with Enhertu or Datroway because they know it could hurt GSK's ADCs' optimum commercial return. That GSK does not sponsor clinical trials with its ADCs and competitor ADCs further shows that it knows it is inducing Tesaro to breach the Collaboration Agreement by requiring Tesaro to provide dostarlimab for clinical trials with dostarlimab competitors. 91. Other similarly situated large pharmaceutical companies pursuing combinations of their PD-1s with their other branded or development-stage biologics seek to reduce the possibility that their drugs can be used with competitor PD-1s. For example, on information and belief, AstraZeneca pursued a label for their CTLA-4 antagonist, Imjudo, which only allows it to be used together with their PD-1 antagonist, Imfinzi. As another example, on information and belief, Bristol Myers Squibb only sells their LAG-3 antagonist as a Fixed-Dose Combination known as Opdualag, where it is packaged and sold together with their PD-1 antagonist, Opdivo, to prevent its use with competing PD-1s. And, on 30 information and belief, Merck investigated only Keytruda for treatment of endometrial cancer in the TroFuse-033 studywhich combines one of Merck's ADCs with Keytrudawithout combining or comparing Keytruda to competing PD-1s. In other words, there are well-known and accepted methods for how to optimize value retention in combination products. Neither Tesaro nor GSK, however, are pursuing those methods for dostarlimab as they advance their ADC portfolio in combination with multiple PD-1 antagonist competitors. 92. Third, knowing that its conduct violated the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro tried to hide it by failing to disclose the dostarlimab-related trials and the data generated from them. Such actions are themselves a breach of the notice obligations under the Agreement. 93. Rather than providing required disclosures, Tesaro and GSK have engaged in a pattern of deception. They conspired to fraudulently conceal the I- SPY Trial in the Amendment. Then, over twenty written updates and multiple JRC meetings related to Tesaro's efforts under the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro and GSK falsely represented by omission that they were not participating in the I- SPY Trial. Nor did Tesaro or GSK timely disclose the BEHOLD EC-02 study or another study called BEHOLD-2. BEHOLD-2 investigates the safety and efficacy of a GSK ADC and several \"anticancer therapies.\" Tesaro and GSK did not disclose that one of these \"anticancer therapies\" was dostarlimab until after 31 AnaptysBio provided notice of material breach. Two drugs in the BEHOLD-2 study are still ambiguously referred to as \"anticancer therapies.\" One wonders why. 94. All said, Tesaro's and GSK's reasons for deceiving AnaptysBio are plain: they seek not to \"obtain the optimum commercial return\" for dostarlimab as Section 8.1 requires. 95. Fourth, at least the I-SPY, BEHOLD-2, and BEHOLD EC-02 trials identified above include dostarlimab. While public statements indicate that it is GSK who is participating in these trials, Tesaro has never provided AnaptysBio any agreement (despite AnaptysBio's requests) that establish how GSK has the necessary dostarlimab rights to do so. 96. Whether there is a written agreement or not, Tesaro has improperly granted GSK rights to dostarlimab in violation of its licensing obligations. (See, e.g., Ex. 2 5.3(e).) 97. On information and belief, Tesaro has directly or indirectly participated in additional clinical trials that breach the Collaboration Agreement for the same reasons as set forth above, and as will be revealed through discovery. 32 COUNT I Tesaro's Breaches of the Collaboration Agreement 98. AnaptysBio repeats and re-alleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. 99. The Collaboration Agreement is a valid and binding contract. 100. AnaptysBio fully performed its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. 101. As part of its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro agreed not to \"knowingly conduct, participate in, license or fund, directly or indirectly, alone or with any Affiliate or Third Party, research or development with respect to, or manufacturing or commercialization of, a Target Antagonist.\" (Ex. 2 5.3(b).) 102. As part of its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro further agreed to \"use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to . . . commercialize Products and attempt to obtain the optimum commercial return for each Product in all major markets throughout the world.\" (Ex. 1 8.1(e).) Dostarlimab is a Product. 103. As part of its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro agreed that \"it will not assign, license, or otherwise transfer its intellectual property rights granted by AnaptysBio in respect of the Products,\" which includes 33 dostarlimab, \"under the Collaboration Agreement to GSK or any GSK Affiliates.\" (Ex. 2 5.3(e).) 104. As part of its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro agreed to timely provide AnaptysBio with information regarding dostarlimab's development, including information related to preclinical, clinical, and commercial advancement of dostarlimab. (Ex. 1 3.2(b); Ex. 2 4.6(b)(i)-(iii).) 105. As part of its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro agreed to disclose all clinical trials that GSK or Tesaro planned to conduct or were conducting at the time the Amendment was signed in October 2020. (Ex. 2 8.1; id. Ex. D.) 106. Tesaro breached the notice provisions in Sections 3.2 and 4.6 at least by actively concealing the I-SPY Trial and failing to disclose the BEHOLD-2 and BEHOLD EC-02 clinical trials, and by actively concealing related information that Tesaro was required to disclose. Tesaro made fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions in mandatory information reports and during JRC meetings in an attempt to prevent AnaptysBio from discovering these trials and other development, commercialization, and business information regarding dostarlimab. Tesaro breached its notice obligations in an attempt to prevent AnaptysBio from exercising its rights, including its reversion rights. 34 107. Tesaro breached its exclusivity obligation in Section 5.3(b), as amended, by directly or indirectly participating in clinical trials, including at least the I-SPY and BEHOLD EC-02 trials, which include prohibited Target Antagonists. Tesaro participated directly or indirectly at least by providing dostarlimab or required dostarlimab intellectual property for these studies, and through other forms of participation and conduct. 108. Tesaro breached the licensing restriction in Section 5.3(e) by providing GSK rights to dostarlimab for GSK's use in at least the I-SPY, BEHOLD-2, and BEHOLD EC-02 studies. 109. Tesaro breached its obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts \"to obtain the optimum commercial return\" for dostarlimab (Jemperli) at least by directly or indirectly participating in the I-SPY and BEHOLD EC-02 clinical trials which include prohibited Target Antagonists, including Merck's Keytruda. 110. Tesaro also breached its obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts because GSK has been participating in clinical trials that undermine dostarlimab's optimum commercial return and, instead of seeking to stop such activity, Tesaro has continued to enlist GSK to assist with dostarlimab's development and commercialization. Participation in the research and development of PD-1s that compete with dostarlimab does not \"obtain the optimum commercial return\" for dostarlimab at least because dostarlimab competes head-to-head with its 35 competitor PD-1s, and any expansion of the commercial opportunity for its PD-1 competitors harms the commercial return of dostarlimab. Further, rather than trying to obtain the optimum commercial return for dostarlimab, Tesaro put dostarlimab's commercial return at risk by allowing GSK to conduct clinical trials that favor GSK's ADCs even if it comes at the expense of dostarlimab. Those clinical trials (e.g., BEHOLD EC-02) are designed to optimize only GSK's ADC portfolio and may benefit those competitors at dostarlimab's direct expense. On information and belief, and consistent with the examples set forth above, neither Tesaro nor a similarly situated company would sponsor or allow a subcontractor or affiliate to conduct such trials with their own products if they were trying to obtain the optimum commercial return for those products. Nor would Tesaro enlist, or continue to enlist, an affiliate or third-party to help develop its own products if that affiliate or third-party was engaging in conduct that could hurt Tesaro's products' commercial prospects. 111. To the extent that Tesaro engaged GSK to perform dostarlimab development and commercialization activities, Tesaro breached its obligations by allowing GSK to participate, or at least failing to try to stop GSK from participating, in clinical trials that threatened dostarlimab's commercial return and thus breached its diligence obligation. Tesaro further breached by failing to require GSK to seek to expand the indications in which dostarlimab can be used. 36 112. Further, Tesaro breached its obligation to seek the optimum commercial return for dostarlimab by failing to pursue development directed towards future regulatory approval for it as a monotherapy or combination therapy with GSK's ADCs in additional indications, such as small cell lung cancer, in which it has publicly stated that it is excited about combination data generated with GSK's ADCs and a PD(L)-1 antagonist. On information and belief, when Tesaro, or a similarly situated company, are seeking to obtain the optimum commercial return for their own products, they seek to increase the indications in which those products can be used. On information and belief, when Tesaro, or a similarly situated company, seeks to obtain the optimum commercial return for their own products in the context of combination therapies, they attempt to ensure that only their product receives approval for use in the combination therapy, or they co- formulate both components to prevent physicians from substituting with a competing product. 113. By at least these actions, Tesaro breached at least the above-identified obligations under the Collaboration Agreement. 114. AnaptysBio has no adequate legal remedy for Tesaro's refusal to comply with its contractual obligations. Tesaro has participated or allowed GSK to participate in clinical trials with Keytruda and other PD-1s that are commercially available, which means physicians can prescribe those drugs without any limits. 37 These prescriptions will alter the PD-1 market to dostarlimab's detriment. Continuation of the planned BEHOLD EC-02 study as designed, or other trials that may be planned now or in the future, which includes a combination of GSK's ADC with Keytruda will therefore cause irreparable harm to AnaptysBio such that monetary damages alone would be insufficient. 115. Accordingly, AnaptysBio should be awarded a declaration that Tesaro has materially breached the Collaboration Agreement and that Tesaro's breaches are incurable. Because the breaches are incurable, AnaptysBio is entitled to specific performancerights to dostarlimab revert from Tesaro to AnaptysBio after such declaration is issued. 116. Tesaro's failures to comply with its contractual obligations have also directly and proximately caused significant damages to AnaptysBio, including in the form of loss of competitive position in the marketplace, other economic losses, and other general and specific damages in an amount to be proven at trial. COUNT II Tesaro's Breaches of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing 117. AnaptysBio repeats and realleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. 38 118. Tesaro, in entering into the Collaboration Agreement and the Amendment, made an implied promise not to unfairly interfere with AnaptysBio's right to receive the benefits of the Collaboration Agreement. 119. During the course of performance under the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and unfairly interfered with AnaptysBio's right to receive the benefits of the contract, at least by trying to circumvent the notice, exclusivity, diligence, and licensing provisions. Tesaro attempted to circumvent the Collaboration Agreement by enlisting an affiliate, GSK, to conduct development and commercialization activities for it without undertaking any effort to ensure that GSK's conduct complied with the Collaboration Agreement. Tesaro's actions were unreasonable and constitute bad faith, and were designed to elevate GSK's and its own commercial interests at dostarlimab's expense. 120. AnaptysBio has no adequate legal remedy for Tesaro's breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. As described above, continuing the planned BEHOLD EC-02 clinical trial for a combination treatment of GSK's ADC and Keytruda will cause irreparable harm to AnaptysBio such that monetary damages alone would be inadequate. Accordingly, AnaptysBio should be awarded equitable relief. 39 121. Accordingly, AnaptysBio should be awarded a declaration that Tesaro has materially breached the Collaboration Agreement and that Tesaro's breaches are incurable. Because the breaches are incurable, AnaptysBio is entitled to specific performancerights to dostarlimab revert from Tesaro to AnaptysBio after such declaration is issued. 122. As a result of Tesaro's breach of the Collaboration Agreement, AnaptysBio will suffer loss of competitive position in the marketplace, other economic losses, and other general and specific damages in an amount to be proven at trial. COUNT III GSK's Tortious Interference with Contract 123. AnaptysBio repeats and re-alleges the foregoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. 124. AnaptysBio and Tesaro entered into a valid, written contract, described herein as the Collaboration Agreement. 125. GSK has tortiously interfered with the Collaboration Agreement. 126. At all relevant times, GSK knew about the Collaboration Agreement and its terms, including at least the notice, licensing, diligence, and exclusivity provisions. GSK knew about the Collaboration Agreement terms at least because GSK owns and controls Tesaro and because its employees participate in the JRC 40 meetings and are now responsible for dostarlimab's development. GSK also knows because it participated in the parties' prior dispute, including the settlement of that dispute, which resulted in the Amendment. 127. With the intent to cause breach and harm to AnaptysBio's competitive position, GSK intentionally encouraged, induced, and/or enabled Tesaro's breach of at least the Collaboration Agreement's notice, licensing, exclusivity, and diligence provisions. 128. First, GSK encouraged or required Tesaro to fraudulently misrepresent in the October 2020 Amendment the dostarlimab clinical trials that it and GSK were conducting or planning to conduct. 129. Second, GSK encouraged or required Tesaro to make additional fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions in contractually required information reports and during JRC meetings. These misrepresentations and omissions were designed to hide Tesaro's participation in clinical trials involving dostarlimab and/or Target Antagonists. And they were designed to conceal Tesaro's breaches of the Collaboration Agreement, and were intended to and did harm AnaptysBio by hindering its ability to monitor Tesaro's compliance with the Collaboration Agreement and exercising its reversion rights. 130. Third, GSK encouraged or required Tesaro to provide GSK with dostarlimab for clinical trials that included Target Antagonists, breaching the 41 exclusivity provision because Tesaro was directly or indirectly participating in the research or development of Target Antagonists. 131. Fourth, GSK encouraged or required Tesaro to improperly assign, license, or otherwise transfer Tesaro's dostarlimab intellectual property rights to GSK. Such transfers were conducted to facilitate, among other things, GSK's use of dostarlimab in prohibited clinical trials that included competitor Target Antagonists. 132. Fifth, by requiring or encouraging Tesaro to directly or indirectly participate in, or facilitate GSK's participation in, prohibited clinical trials, GSK likewise required or encouraged Tesaro to breach its diligence obligations. GSK knew that these clinical trials were designed to favor its ADCs and could damage dostarlimab's commercial return and reduce royalties properly owed to AnaptysBio under the amended Agreement. GSK also knew that the clinical trials that include dostarlimab competitors could harm dostarlimab's commercial return because those products compete head-to-head. 133. There is no justification for GSK's conduct. GSK was aware of Tesaro's obligations. This is not an instance of GSK inducing its subsidiary Tesaro to engage in an \"efficient breach.\" Instead, GSK has denied that its and Tesaro's participation in these trials constitute a breach. And Tesaro's breach of the 42 Collaboration Agreement's exclusivity and commercial reasonable efforts provisions cannot be remedied adequately through monetary damages. 134. As a direct and proximate result of the intentional and knowing actions of GSK, AnaptysBio's contractual relationship with Tesaro was disrupted, in that GSK enabled, encouraged, or induced, Tesaro's breach of at least the notice, diligence, licensing, and exclusivity provisions in the Collaboration Agreement. 135. GSK intentionally interfered with AnaptysBio's and Tesaro's contractual obligations to cause harm to AnaptysBio. On information and belief, GSK wanted the economic benefit of revenues from sales of its ADCs, regardless of Tesaro's contractual obligations to AnaptysBio. GSK's actions were improper and unjustified. GSK has acted in willful and conscious disregard of AnaptysBio's rights. 136. AnaptysBio has no adequate legal remedy for GSK's tortious interference. As described above, and incorporated herein by reference, the planned and governed BEHOLD EC-02 study, which is scheduled to start enrolling patients in Q1 2026, will cause irreparable harm to AnaptysBio such that monetary damages alone would be inadequate. Further, AnaptysBio has already been irreparably harmed by GSK's tortious interference related to the I-SPY trial and the other activities described herein. On information and belief, GSK has induced Tesaro to breach the Collaboration Agreement in connection with other clinical 43 trials that include dostarlimab, dostarlimab's competitors, or GSK's ADCs. Accordingly, AnaptysBio should be awarded equitable relief. 137. As a direct result of GSK's actions, AnaptysBio has suffered economic losses and other general and specific damages in an amount to be proven at trial. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, AnaptysBio requests that the Court enter an order: a) Declaring that the relevant provisions in the Collaboration Agreement and the Amendment are valid and enforceable; b) Declaring that Tesaro has materially breached the Collaboration Agreement and GSK has tortiously interfered with the Collaboration Agreement; c) Declaring that AnaptysBio is entitled to all rights and remedies under Collaboration Agreement Sections 8.2, 14.2, 14.4, including terminating the agreement and dostarlimab's reversion; d) Declaring that Tesaro's material breaches are uncurable; e) Ordering Tesaro to specifically perform its obligations under the Collaboration Agreement because of its material breaches, including by reverting rights to dostarlimab to AnaptysBio after a declaration of material breach is issued; f) Awarding AnaptysBio all appropriate damages to compensate for its economic loss; 44 g) Awarding AnaptysBio its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to the extent allowed by law; and h) Granting such other and future relief as the Court deems just and proper.

On November 25, 2025, the board of directors (the \" Board of Directors \") of The E.W. Scripps Company (the \" Company \") declared a dividend of one right (a \" Right \") for each outstanding Class A Common share, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the \" Class A Common Shares \") and each outstanding Common Voting share, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the \" Common Voting Shares \"). The dividend is payable on December 8, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on that date (the \" Record Date \"). Each Right, once exercisable, entitles the registered holder of (a) Class A Common Shares to purchase from the Company one (1) Class A Common Share and (b) Common Voting Shares to purchase from the Company one (1) Common Voting Share (subject to adjustment), at a price of $2.19, subject to certain adjustments (the \" Exercise Price \"). The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement, dated as of November 26, 2025 (as it may be amended from time to time, the \" Rights Agreement \"), by and between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent (the \" Rights Agent \"). Board of Directors Company Right Class A Common Shares Common Voting Shares Record Date Exercise Price Rights Agreement Rights Agent The following description of the terms of the Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Rights Agreement, including the exhibits thereto, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. Distribution and Exercise of Rights; Distribution Date and Expiration Date Subject to the terms and conditions of the Rights Agreement, the Rights will be issued in respect of all Class A Common Shares and Common Voting Shares, as applicable, outstanding on the Record Date, and in respect of all Class A Common Shares and Common Voting Shares issued after the Record Date and prior to the earliest to occur of the Distribution Date (as defined below) and the Expiration Date (as defined below). In addition, following the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Company may issue Rights in respect of any voting shares of the Company issued or sold pursuant to any of the following, to the extent already existing or outstanding prior to the Distribution Date: the exercise of stock options, under any employee plan or arrangement, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities, notes or debentures issued by the Company or pursuant to contractual obligations of the Company. The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date and will expire upon the close of business on the earliest to occur of: (i) November 26, 2026, (ii) the date on which the rights are redeemed or exchanged by the Board of Directors in accordance with the Rights Agreement or (iii) the date of the Company's 2026 annual meeting of stockholders if requisite stockholder approval of the Rights Agreement is not obtained at such meeting (such date, the \" Expiration Date \"). Expiration Date Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Rights Agreement, the Rights will separate from the Class A Common Shares and Common Voting Shares and become exercisable upon the close of business on the day (the \" Distribution Date \") which is the earlier to occur of (i) the tenth (10th) business day following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Rights Agreement) has acquired beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding Class A Common Shares (an \" Acquiring Person \") and (ii) the tenth (10th) business day (or such later date as may be determined by the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of the commencement of, or the first public announcement of the intention to commence, by any person (other than an Exempt Person, as defined in the Rights Agreement) a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in such person or group of affiliated or associated persons becoming an Acquiring Person. For purposes of calculating beneficial ownership under the Rights Agreement, certain synthetic interests in securities created by derivative positions are treated as beneficial ownership of the number of Class A Common Shares equivalent to the economic exposure created by the derivative security. Transfer of Rights prior to the Distribution Date; Right Certificates Prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will not be represented by a separate certificate, and will be evidenced by the certificate or book-entry account, as applicable, representing record ownership of the associated Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares, as applicable. Until the earlier of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date, any new Class A Common Share certificate (the \" Share Certificates \") or Common Voting Share certificates (the \" Voting Share Certificates \") issued after the Record Date will, in each case, contain a legend incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Notice of such legend will also be provided to holders of any new uncertificated Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares, as applicable. The Rights Agreement provides that, prior to the Distribution Date (or the earlier occurrence of the Expiration Date), the Rights will be transferrable only together with the transfer of the Class A Common Shares and the Common Voting Shares. During such period, the surrender for transfer of any Share Certificates or Voting Share Certificates, as applicable (or the effectuation of a book-entry transfer of Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares, as applicable) will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with such Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares, as applicable, represented thereby. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights (\" Right Certificates \") will be mailed to holders of record of the Class A Common Shares and Common Voting Shares, as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, and such separate certificates alone will evidence the Rights from and after the Distribution Date. The Company and the Rights Agent may from time to time amend the Rights Agreement to provide for uncertificated Rights in addition to or in place of Rights evidenced by Rights Certificates. Class A Common Shares and Common Voting Shares Purchasable Upon Exercise of Rights After the Distribution Date, each Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person and certain affiliates, associates and transferees thereof, whose Rights will have become null and void) will entitle the holder to purchase, upon payment of the Exercise Price, one (1) Class A Common Share or Common Voting Share, as applicable (subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments set forth in the Rights Agreement and described below). 2 Subject to certain exceptions specified in the Rights Agreement, the Rights will separate from the Class A Common Shares and Common Voting Shares and become exercisable upon the close of business on the day (the \" Distribution Date \") which is the earlier to occur of (i) the tenth (10th) business day following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Rights Agreement) has acquired beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding Class A Common Shares (an \" Acquiring Person \") and (ii) the tenth (10th) business day (or such later date as may be determined by the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of the commencement of, or the first public announcement of the intention to commence, by any person (other than an Exempt Person, as defined in the Rights Agreement) a tender or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in such person or group of affiliated or associated persons becoming an Acquiring Person. For purposes of calculating beneficial ownership under the Rights Agreement, certain synthetic interests in securities created by derivative positions are treated as beneficial ownership of the number of Class A Common Shares equivalent to the economic exposure created by the derivative security. Distribution Date Acquiring Person Transfer of Rights prior to the Distribution Date; Right Certificates Prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will not be represented by a separate certificate, and will be evidenced by the certificate or book-entry account, as applicable, representing record ownership of the associated Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares, as applicable. Until the earlier of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date, any new Class A Common Share certificate (the \" Share Certificates \") or Common Voting Share certificates (the \" Voting Share Certificates \") issued after the Record Date will, in each case, contain a legend incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Notice of such legend will also be provided to holders of any new uncertificated Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares, as applicable. Share Certificates Voting Share Certificates The Rights Agreement provides that, prior to the Distribution Date (or the earlier occurrence of the Expiration Date), the Rights will be transferrable only together with the transfer of the Class A Common Shares and the Common Voting Shares. During such period, the surrender for transfer of any Share Certificates or Voting Share Certificates, as applicable (or the effectuation of a book-entry transfer of Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares, as applicable) will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with such Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares, as applicable, represented thereby. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights (\" Right Certificates \") will be mailed to holders of record of the Class A Common Shares and Common Voting Shares, as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, and such separate certificates alone will evidence the Rights from and after the Distribution Date. The Company and the Rights Agent may from time to time amend the Rights Agreement to provide for uncertificated Rights in addition to or in place of Rights evidenced by Rights Certificates. Right Certificates Class A Common Shares and Common Voting Shares Purchasable Upon Exercise of Rights After the Distribution Date, each Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person and certain affiliates, associates and transferees thereof, whose Rights will have become null and void) will entitle the holder to purchase, upon payment of the Exercise Price, one (1) Class A Common Share or Common Voting Share, as applicable (subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments set forth in the Rights Agreement and described below). 2 Anti-Dilution The Exercise Price, the number of outstanding Rights and the number of Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares, as applicable, issuable upon exercise of the Rights are subject to certain adjustments from time to time to prevent dilution in the event of a stock dividend on, stock split affecting or a subdivision or combination of, or a reclassification of, the Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares, as applicable, or if a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person. With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Exercise Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment, upward or downward, of at least 1% in such Exercise Price. Consequences of a Person or Group Becoming an Acquiring Person Flip-In Trigger. In the event that a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person and certain affiliates, associates and transferees thereof, whose Rights will have become null and void), will thereafter entitle the holder to purchase (in lieu of acquiring one (1) Class A Common Share or Common Voting Share, as applicable), upon payment of the Exercise Price, a number of Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares having a fair market value (determined pursuant to the Rights Agreement) equal to approximately two (2) times the Exercise Price in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement. Flip-Over Trigger. In the event that, after the time that a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination (in which any Class A Common Shares or Common Voting Shares are changed into or exchanged for other securities or assets) or more than fifty percent (50%) of the consolidated assets or earning power of the Company and its subsidiaries are sold, proper provision will be made so that each holder of record of a Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person and certain affiliates, associates and transferees thereof, whose Rights will have become null and void) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise of the Right, that number of shares of common stock of the Principal Party (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) having a fair market value at the time of such transaction determined in accordance with the Rights Agreement equal to approximately two (2) times the Exercise Price. Exchange of Rights.

With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Exercise Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment, upward or downward, of at least 1% in such Exercise Price.

Amendments For as long as the Rights are then redeemable, the Company may amend the Rights Agreement in any manner without the approval of any holders of the Rights. After the Rights are no longer redeemable, the Company may amend the Rights Agreement (other than the Redemption Price or in a manner that would cause the Rights to again become redeemable) without the approval of any holders of the Rights so long as amendment does not materially adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights (other than an Acquiring Person or any other person in whose hands Rights have become null and in accordance with the Rights Agreement).

Scripps Company's (NASDAQ: SSP) board of directors has approved the adoption of a limited-duration shareholder rights plan following the public disclosure of an unsolicited, non-binding acquisition proposal for the company. The board adopted the rights plan to ensure that all shareholders receive full value in connection with any proposal to acquire the company. The rights plan is intended to protect shareholders from coercive tactics and to provide the board with time to thoroughly evaluate the offer and any other potential strategic alternatives. The rights plan is effective immediately and will expire in one year. The rights plan leaves open all paths to create shareholder value Kim Williams, the chair of Scripps' board, said, \"The board is committed to acting in the best interests of all Scripps shareholders. The rights plan safeguards shareholders' ability to receive appropriate value for their investment and ensures that the board can assess the recently received proposal, and any strategic alternatives, in a thoughtful and orderly manner.\" About the rights plan Pursuant to the rights plan, Scripps will issue, by means of a dividend, one Class A common share right for each outstanding Class A common share and one common voting share right for each outstanding common voting share to shareholders of record on the close of business on Dec. 8, 2025. Initially, these rights will not be exercisable and will trade with, and be represented by, the Class A common shares and the common voting shares, respectively. The rights plan is effective immediately and has a one-year duration, expiring on Nov. 26, 2026. Under the rights plan, the rights generally become exercisable only if a person or group (each, an \"acquiring person\") acquires beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common shares. In that situation, each holder of a Class A common share right (other than the acquiring person, whose rights will become void and will not be exercisable) will be entitled to purchase, at the exercise price, additional Scripps Class A common shares at a 50% discount to the then-current market price. In addition, if Scripps is acquired in a merger or other business combination after an unapproved party acquires more than 10% of the outstanding Class A common shares, each holder of a right would then be entitled to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, shares of the acquiring company's stock at a 50% discount. The board may, at its option, exchange each right (other than rights owned by the acquiring person that have become void) in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one Class A common share per outstanding right, subject to adjustment. Except as provided in the rights plan, the board is entitled to redeem the rights at $0.001 per right. person or group beneficially owns 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common shares prior to Scripps' announcement of its adoption of the rights plan, then that person's or group's existing ownership percentage will be grandfathered, although, with certain exceptions, the rights will become exercisable if at any time after the announcement of the adoption of the rights plan such person or group increases its ownership of Class A common shares by more than 0.10% of outstanding Class A common shares. Additional details regarding the rights plan are contained in a Form to be filed by Scripps with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Investor contact: Carolyn Micheli, The E.W.

The increase in Retail segment comparable net sales was driven by high single-digit positive growth in both digital channel sales and retail store sales. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 12.5% at Urban Outfitters, 7.6% at Anthropologie and 4.1% at Free People. Subscription segment net sales increased by 48.7% primarily driven by a 42.2% increase in average active subscribers in the current quarter versus the prior year quarter. Wholesale segment net sales increased 7.6% driven by an 8.4% increase in Free People wholesale sales primarily due to an increase in sales to specialty customers. For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, total Company net sales increased 11.5% to a record $4.36 billion. Total Retail segment net sales increased 8.0%, with comparable Retail segment net sales increasing 6.1%.

Hayne, Chief Executive Officer. \"Trends observed last quarter have remained consistent with broad-based comparable sales growth and robust results in the Retail, Subscription, and Wholesale segments. These results underscore the strength of our diversified business model, which enables us to continue capturing market share, and drive consistent long-term growth,\" finished Mr. Hayne. Net sales by brand and segment for the three and nine-month periods were as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 31, October 31, Net sales by brand Anthropologie 634,828 587,923 1,811,713 1,683,408 Free People 399,272 365,857 1,167,398 1,049,677 Urban Outfitters 339,848 300,577 946,524 887,550 Nuuly 144,629 97,232 407,915 265,870 Menus & Venues 10,773 10,266 30,056 28,041 Total Company 1,529,350 1,361,855 4,363,606 3,914,546 Net sales by segment Retail Segment 1,296,454 1,182,557 3,716,233 3,441,698 Subscription Segment 144,629 97,232 407,915 265,870 Wholesale Segment 88,267 82,066 239,458 206,978 Total Company 1,529,350 1,361,855 4,363,606 3,914,546 For the three months ended October 31, 2025, the gross profit rate increased by 31 basis points compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024, and gross profit dollars increased 13.3% to $563.3 million from $497.3 million. For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, the gross profit rate increased by 135 basis points compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024, and gross profit dollars increased 15.7% to $1.62 billion from $1.40 billion. The increase in gross profit rate for both periods was primarily due to improved Retail segment markdowns driven by lower markdowns at Urban Outfitters and Free People and leverage in store occupancy costs due to the increase in comparable Retail segment net sales, partially offset by deleverage in initial merchandise costs. The increase in gross profit dollars for both periods was due to higher net sales and the improved gross profit rate. Additionally, during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, the Company recorded store impairment charges of $2.0 million, and during the nine months ended October 31, 2024, the Company recorded store impairment and lease abandonment charges of $4.6 million. As of October 31, 2025, total inventory increased by $46.5 million, or 5.9%, compared to total inventory as of October 31, 2024. Total Retail segment inventory increased by 6.3% and comparable Retail segment inventory increased by 7.4%. Wholesale segment inventory was flat. The increase in Retail segment inventory was due to increased sales. For the three months ended October 31, 2025, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $50.4 million, or 13.7%, compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses deleveraged 32 basis points as a percentage of net sales compared to the three months ended October 31, 2024. For the nine months ended October 31, 2025, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $121.1 million, or 11.5%, compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses were essentially flat as a percentage of net sales compared to the nine months ended October 31, 2024. The deleverage in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Subscription segments, partially offset by leverage in store payroll expenses due to the Retail segment stores net sales growth. The dollar growth in selling, general and administrative expenses for both periods was primarily related to increased marketing expenses to support customer growth and increased sales in the Retail and Subscription segments, as well as increased store payroll expenses to support the Retail segment stores net sales growth. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was 23.6%, compared to 24.2% in the three months ended October 31, 2024. The Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, was 22.2%, compared to 23.6% in the nine months ended October 31, 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2025, was primarily attributable to the ratio of foreign taxable earnings to global taxable earnings and the release of certain valuation allowances. Net income for the three months ended October 31, 2025, was a record $116.4 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.28. Net income for the nine months ended October 31, 2025, was a record $368.7 million and earnings per diluted share were $4.01.

Accordingly, pursuant to Section 14.03 of the Indenture, the closing of the Merger and the Delisting resulted in a Make-Whole Fundamental Change that occurred on November 26, 2025. However, because the Stock Price (as defined in the Indenture) is less than $46.85, no Additional Shares (as defined in the Indenture) will be added to the Conversion Rate.

(the \" Company \") pursuant to the provisions of Sections 14.01(b)(iii), 14.03(b), 14.07(b) and 15.02(c) of the Indenture, dated as of April 9, 2021, between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \" Trustee \") (as it may be supplemented from time to time, the \" Indenture \"), relating to the Company's 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due April 15, 2026 (the \" Convertible Notes \"). The Trustee also serves as Paying Agent (in such capacity, the \" Notes Paying Agent \") and as Conversion Agent under the Indenture. Capitalized terms used in this Notice, unless otherwise defined herein, have the meanings given to such terms in the Indenture. A Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occurred on November 26, 2025 as a result of the consummation of the merger on such date of the Company and Viking Merger Sub, Inc. (\" Merger Sub \"), with the Company continuing as the surviving entity (the \" Merger \"), as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 24, 2025 (the \" Merger Agreement \"), by and among the Company, Merger Sub and Calabrio, Inc. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 15.02(a) of the Indenture, as a result of the Fundamental Change, the holder of each Convertible Note outstanding as of the time of the Fundamental Change (each, a \" Holder \") has, subject to certain conditions, the right by giving notice or following The Depository Trust Company \") procedures as stated herein to require the Company to repurchase all or any portion of such Holder's Convertible Notes in a principal amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date identified below (the \" Fundamental Change Repurchase Price \").

Payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price will be made in cash by the Notes Paying Agent from funds deposited with it by the Company or on the Company's behalf on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date upon presentation and surrender of the Convertible Notes as set forth below under \"Manner of Repurchase\" below. On the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price will become due and payable on the portion of the Convertible Notes submitted to the Company for repurchase, interest will cease to accrue on the portion of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being repurchased, such Convertible Notes being repurchased will cease to be outstanding and all other rights of the Holders of such Convertible Notes will terminate (other than the right to receive payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price), unless the Company defaults in making payment of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price. If a Holder does not exercise its right to require the Company to repurchase Convertible Notes owned by such Holder, then after the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date and upon surrender of the Convertible Notes as to which such right has been exercised, a new Convertible Note or Convertible Notes in principal amount at issuance equal to the portion of the Convertible Notes not submitted to the Company for repurchase will be issued (or transferred by book entry) upon cancellation of the original Convertible Note. The CUSIP number is included solely for the convenience of the Holders. Neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be responsible for the selection or use of the CUSIP number, nor is any representation made as to its correctness with respect to the Convertible Notes or as indicated in this Notice. Holders who deliver their Convertible Notes and a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice to the Notes Paying Agent and do not properly and validly withdraw such notice prior to the Withdrawal Date identified below will not be permitted to convert their Convertible Notes. See \"Conversion Rights\" below. Holders of Convertible Notes should consider the following important deadlines in connection with this Notice: Calendar Date and Time Event Expiration Date Close of business (5:00 p.m. New York City time), on December 24, 2025 The last day for Holders to elect to require the repurchase of Convertible Notes by the Company and deliver Convertible Notes pursuant to this Notice.

The Company deposits with the Notes Paying Agent the amount of cash necessary to pay each electing and delivering Holder the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price. The Notes Paying Agent pays each electing Holder who has delivered the Convertible Notes prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 24, 2025 the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price in cash for all of the Convertible Notes properly and validly delivered (and not validly withdrawn) by such Holder. Neither the Company nor the Trustee, Notes Paying Agent and Conversion Agent make any recommendation as to whether Holders should elect to require the Company to repurchase their Convertible Notes. MANNER OF REPURCHASE All Convertible Notes are currently Global Notes. If you are the owner of a beneficial interest in the Convertible Notes through DTC and you elect to submit your Convertible Notes for repurchase, you must, on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 24, 2025: complete the appropriate instruction form pursuant to DTC's book-entry program; deliver through DTC's book-entry system your beneficial interest, together with an agent's message transmitted by DTC to the Notes Paying Agent (instead of delivering the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice described below); and follow any other required directions as instructed by DTC. The term \"agent's message\" means a message, transmitted by DTC to, and received by, the Notes Paying Agent and forming a part of a book-entry confirmation, which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgment from the participant submitting the Convertible Notes for repurchase, which acknowledgment states that such participant has received and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice. Each beneficial owner of a beneficial interest in the Convertible Notes that has properly and validly delivered such beneficial interest and agent's message for repurchase through DTC, and not validly withdrawn such delivery prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 24, 2025, will receive the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price through the facilities of DTC promptly following the later of (i) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date and (ii) the time of the book-entry transfer or delivery of the Convertible Notes by such beneficial owner. Delivery by any owner of a beneficial interest in the Convertible Notes, together with an agent's message through the facilities of DTC prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on December 24, 2025, is a condition to the receipt by such beneficial owner of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price for such Convertible Notes on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date. In order for any Holder of Convertible Notes that are Certificated Notes to exercise its right to require the Company to repurchase a Convertible Note at the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, such Holder must, on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 24, 2025: deliver to the Notes Paying Agent a duly completed and signed notice (the \" Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice \") in the form set forth as Exhibit A , with appropriate signature guarantee hereto; and deliver the Certificated Notes representing the Convertible Notes to be repurchased to the Notes Paying Agent at any time after delivery of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice (together with all necessary endorsements for transfer) at the office of the Notes Paying Agent (as set forth below), such delivery being a condition to receipt by the Holder of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price therefor. A Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice for Convertible Notes that are Certificated Notes may be delivered by mail, overnight courier, hand delivery, facsimile transmission or other written form. NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL Any Holder of Convertible Notes that are Certificated Notes who has given a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice may withdraw such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice, in whole or in part, by delivery of a written notice of withdrawal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the \" Withdrawal Notice \") to the office of the Notes Paying Agent at any time on or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 24, 2025. A Withdrawal Notice must specify: the certificate number, if the Certificated Notes have been issued, of the Convertible Note in respect of which such Withdrawal Notice is being submitted; the principal amount of the Convertible Notes with respect to which such Withdrawal Notice is being submitted, which must be in principal amounts of $1,000 or an integral multiple in excess thereof; and the principal amount, if any, of such Convertible Notes that remain subject to the original Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice, which portion must be in principal amounts of $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000. A Withdrawal Notice for Certificated Notes may be delivered by mail, overnight courier, hand delivery, facsimile transmission or other written form. Beneficial owners who deliver their beneficial interest in the Convertible Notes through DTC need not submit a physical Withdrawal Notice to the Notes Paying Agent if such beneficial owners comply with the transmittal procedures of DTC for submitting a notice of withdrawal which must be received by the Notes Paying Agent prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 24, 2025. Any physical Withdrawal Notice delivered by beneficial owners or such transmittal through DTC must contain the information specified in the above Withdrawal Notice (including, in lieu of the certificate number, the appropriate DTC information relating to the Convertible Notes that are being withdrawn). The Notes Paying Agent will promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice or Withdrawal Notice. CONVERSION RIGHTS Holders who do not elect to require the Company to repurchase their Convertible Notes will retain their Convertible Notes, which will continue to be convertible subject to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Indenture. On November 26, 2025 or after, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes will change into a right to convert such principal amount of Convertible Notes into cash in an amount equal to the $20.50 multiplied by a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, subject to any adjustment for conversion in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change. Pursuant to the first supplemental indenture, dated as of November 26, 2025, entered into between the Company and the Trustee in connection with the consummation of the Merger (the \" Supplemental Indenture \"), each Holder of a Convertible Note has the right to convert the principal amount of Convertible Notes into cash equal to $20.50 multiplied by a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the Merger would have been entitled to receive upon the consummation of the Merger (the \" Conversion Value \"), which will be cash equal to $330.24 per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes based on a Conversion Rate of 16.1092. In connection with the closing of the Merger, the Common Stock is no longer being traded on the Nasdaq Global Market as of November 26, 2025 (the \" Delisting \"). Accordingly, pursuant to Section 14.03 of the Indenture, the closing of the Merger and the Delisting resulted in a Make-Whole Fundamental Change that occurred on November 26, 2025. However, because the Stock Price is less than $46.85, no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate. The Conversion Value is fixed as of the date of the Merger and is not subject to further adjustment. At the time of this Notice the Convertible Notes are eligible for conversion as provided by the terms of the Indenture. Holders may elect to convert such Convertible Notes at any time from November 26, 2025 (being the Effective Date of the Merger) but before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Business Day immediately prior to the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (the Make-Whole Conversion Period \"). In order to receive the Conversion Value during the Make-Whole Conversion Period, prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 24, 2025, such Holder must: in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of DTC in effect at that time and, if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes, if any, as set forth in Section 14.02(e) of the Indenture; and in the case of Certificated Notes: complete, manually sign and deliver, with an appropriate signature guarantee, an irrevocable notice to the Conversion Agent in the form on the reverse of such Convertible Note (or a facsimile thereof) ( Exhibit C hereto) (a \" Notice of Conversion \") at the office of the Conversion Agent (as set forth below), and state in writing therein the principal amount of Convertible Note to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such Holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered; surrender such Convertible Note, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent; and if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and pay all transfer or similar taxes, if any, as set forth in Section 14.02(e) of the Indenture. A Convertible Note will be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the \" Conversion Date \") that the Holder has complied with the requirements set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph. The Company will pay the consideration due in respect of the Conversion Obligation in cash on the second Business Day immediately following the relevant Conversion Date. If more than one Convertible Note is surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Convertible Notes will be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered. The Conversion Agent will promptly notify the Company of any conversion on the Conversion Date for such conversion. Any Convertible Notes as to which a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice has been given may be converted pursuant to the third preceding paragraph only if the applicable Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice has been validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, which are described above. Neither the Company nor the Trustee, Notes Paying Agent and Conversion Agent make any recommendation as to whether Holders should elect to convert their Convertible Notes.

In order to avoid backup withholding of federal income tax on the cash received upon the surrender of Convertible Notes for repurchase, the Holder must, unless an exemption applies, provide his or her correct taxpayer identification number (\" \") on the Internal Revenue Service (\" \") Form included herein and certify, under penalties of perjury, that such number is correct and that he or she is not subject to backup withholding. The TIN for an individual is generally his or her social security number. If the correct TIN is not provided, the IRS may impose a penalty and payments made with respect to the surrendered Convertible Notes may be subject to backup withholding of 24%. Backup withholding is not an additional federal income tax. Rather, the federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained from the IRS. Exempt persons (including, among others, most corporations) are not subject to backup withholding (although foreign persons may be subject to nonresident withholding unless certain requirements are met). A foreign person may qualify as an exempt person for backup withholding purposes and may also demonstrate an exemption from certain nonresident withholding rules by submitting an IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or another version of Form signed under penalties of perjury, certifying such person's foreign status. Non-U.S. persons should carefully read the instructions to the applicable IRS Form and, if applicable, complete the required information, sign and date the IRS Form and return the form. In certain cases, IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E may not be the proper IRS form to be completed and returned, depending on the status of the foreign person claiming exemption from withholding. Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E and other versions of Form may be obtained from the IRS website at http://www.irs.gov. A Holder of Convertible Notes should consult his or her tax advisor as to his or her qualification for an exemption from backup and nonresident withholding and the procedure for obtaining such exemptions.
