The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.25 % per year, payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2026. The Notes will be convertible into cash or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, without par value (\"Common Stock\"), as described below. The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company, and will mature on March 15, 2029, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The Company issued the Notes pursuant to an indenture (the \"Indenture\"), dated as of December 4, 2025, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the \"Trustee\"). Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2028, the Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions. On or after December 15, 2028 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at their option at any time at the conversion rate then in effect, irrespective of these conditions. The Company will settle conversions of the Notes by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of its Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its Common Stock, at its election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted. The conversion rate for the Notes will initially be 17.5093 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $57.11 per share of Common Stock). The initial conversion price of the Notes represents a premium of approximately 25% over the last reported sale price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on December 1, 2025. The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may not redeem the Notes prior to the maturity date. If the Company undergoes a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (as defined in the Indenture). In addition, if a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Company may be required, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for any Notes converted in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change by a specified number of shares of its Common Stock. The Indenture provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to grace and cure periods), among others: nonpayment of principal or interest; breach of covenants or other agreements in the Indenture; defaults with respect to certain other indebtedness; failure to pay certain final judgments; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. Generally, if an event of default occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to be immediately due and payable. The Notes will be the Company's senior unsecured obligations and will rank senior in right of payment to any of its indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; rank equal in right of payment to any of the Company's unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; be effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company's senior, secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and be structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries (including trade payables but excluding intercompany obligations and liabilities of a type not required to be reflected on a balance sheet of such subsidiaries in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be approximately $987.5 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions but before deducting other offering expenses. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to repay or refinance debt or for general corporate purposes.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "positive", "score": 0.9966719150543213}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995155334472656}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994791150093079}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994606375694275}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993475079536438}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993523955345154}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992590546607971}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993855953216553}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994553923606873}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9752439856529236}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994569420814514}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9991268515586853}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9988402724266052}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9985124468803406}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993763566017151}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999142050743103}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994332194328308}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9955873489379883}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9802440404891968}], "sentiment": "positive"}, "item 2.03": {"text": "The information included or incorporated by reference in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996242523193359}], "sentiment": "neutral"}, "item 3.02": {"text": "The information included or incorporated by reference in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exelon also granted each of the initial purchasers of the convertible notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period from, and including, the date on which the convertible notes are first issued, up to an additional $100 million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes. The sale of the convertible notes is expected to close on December 4, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. Exelon expects that the net proceeds from the convertible notes will be approximately $888.8 million (or $987.5 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional convertible notes in full), after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions but before deducting other offering expenses. Exelon intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the convertible notes for the repayment or refinancing of debt or for general corporate purposes. The convertible notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Exelon, and will mature on March 15, 2029, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The convertible notes will bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.25% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2026. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding December 15, 2028, the convertible notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only under certain conditions. On or after December 15, 2028, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders of the convertible notes may convert all or any portion of their convertible notes at their option at any time at the conversion rate then in effect, irrespective of these conditions. Exelon will settle conversions of the convertible notes by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes to be converted and paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock, without par value, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes being converted. The conversion rate for the convertible notes will initially be 17.5093 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $57.11 per share of common stock). The initial conversion price of the convertible notes represents a premium of approximately 25% over the last reported sale price of Exelon's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on December 1, 2025. The conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Exelon may not redeem the convertible notes prior to the maturity date. If Exelon undergoes a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture that will govern the convertible notes), subject to certain conditions, holders of the convertible notes may require Exelon to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their convertible notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the indenture that will govern the convertible notes). In addition, if certain fundamental changes occur, Exelon may be required, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for any convertible notes converted in connection with such fundamental changes by a specified number of shares of its common stock. The offering is being made to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Any offers of the convertible notes will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. None of the convertible notes or any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes have been or are expected to be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor will there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

On December 4, 2025, Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (the \"Company\") issued a press release announcing its preliminary financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 31, 2025. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1. The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto is being furnished and shall not be deemed \"filed\" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. The attached earnings press release contains information about the following non-GAAP financial measures (collectively, the \"Non-GAAP Measures\"): Consolidated earnings before interest expense and income taxes (\"EBIT\") and before depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and before inventory impairments and land option write-offs and loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to interest incurred and EBIT before inventory impairments and land option write-offs and loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net (\"Adjusted EBIT\"), which are non-GAAP financial measures. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). Management believes EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA to be relevant and useful information as EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are standard measures commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and others to measure and benchmark the Company's financial performance without the effects of various items the Company does not believe are characteristic of its ongoing operating performance. EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA do not take into account substantial costs of doing business, such as income taxes and interest expense. Homebuilding gross margin, before cost of sales interest expense and land charges, and homebuilding gross margin percentage, before cost of sales interest expense and land charges, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are homebuilding gross margin and homebuilding gross margin percentage, respectively. Management believes homebuilding gross margin, before cost of sales interest expense and land charges, enables investors to better understand the Company's operating performance. This measure is also useful internally, helping management to evaluate the Company's operating results on a consolidated basis and relative to other companies in the Company's industry. In particular, the magnitude and volatility of land charges for the Company, and for other homebuilders, have been significant and, as such, have made financial analysis of the Company's industry more difficult. Homebuilding metrics excluding land charges, as well as interest amortized to cost of sales, and other similar presentations prepared by analysts and other companies are frequently used to assist investors in understanding and comparing the operating characteristics of homebuilding activities by eliminating many of the differences in companies' respective levels of impairments and levels of debt. Adjusted income before income taxes, which is defined as (loss) income before income taxes excluding land-related charges and loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is (loss) income before income taxes. Management believes adjusted income before taxes to be relevant and useful information because it provides a better metric of the Company's operating performance. Total inventories excluding liabilities from inventory not owned, net of debt issuance costs and interest capitalized and including investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures (\"Adjusted Investment\"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is total inventories. Management believes Adjusted Investment to be relevant and useful information because it more accurately reflects inventory owned (whether directly or through joint ventures) by the Company and excludes inventory that is off-balance sheet in nature, such as inventory subject to land banking transactions. The ratio of Adjusted EBIT return on investment (\"Adjusted EBIT ROI\"), which is the ratio of Adjusted EBIT for the trailing twelve-months, to the average Adjusted Investment for the prior five fiscal quarters and is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is the ratio of net income (loss) to total inventory. Management believes Adjusted EBIT ROI to be relevant and useful information because it is a measure of operational performance irrespective of the capital structure of the Company and as calculated, is reflective of the longer-term period required to build and sell homes in the homebuilding industry. Consolidated earnings before interest expense and income taxes (\"EBIT\") and before depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and before inventory impairments and land option write-offs and loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to interest incurred and EBIT before inventory impairments and land option write-offs and loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net (\"Adjusted EBIT\"), which are non-GAAP financial measures.

Reconciliations for historical periods of the Non-GAAP Measures are contained in the earnings press release. The Non-GAAP Measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, their respective most directly comparable financial measures (on a historical period, trailing twelve-month period or five-quarter average basis, as applicable) prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States that are presented on the financial statements included in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, the Company's calculations of the Non-GAAP Measures may be different than the respective calculations used by other companies, and, therefore, comparability may be affected.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9989297986030579}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994505047798157}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995254278182983}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995642304420471}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999609649181366}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999433696269989}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996227025985718}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995484948158264}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996172189712524}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996283054351807}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9585357308387756}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999622106552124}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9985479712486267}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996346235275269}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995143413543701}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999549925327301}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9981794357299805}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996160268783569}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995754361152649}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995203018188477}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995962977409363}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.99951171875}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995880722999573}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995355606079102}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999433696269989}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996227025985718}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995484948158264}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996172189712524}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996283054351807}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9585357308387756}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999622106552124}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9985479712486267}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996346235275269}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995143413543701}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999549925327301}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9981794357299805}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996160268783569}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995754361152649}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995203018188477}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995962977409363}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.99951171875}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995880722999573}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996100068092346}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996381998062134}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994805455207825}], "sentiment": "neutral"}, "item 9.01": {"text": "Financial Statements and Exhibits .

Based on the favorable safety profile observed, the DSMB recommended advancing the trial to Phase II, or the expansion phase, at the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D). The expansion phase will further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of EB103, the Company's CD19-redirected ARTEMIS T-cell therapy, in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In the Phase I dose escalation phase, no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported (n=9). Notably, the majority of patients treated are considered high-risk, including one with Central Nervous System (CNS) lymphoma. The high-dose cohort achieved a 100% complete response (CR) rate at Month 1 in all evaluable patients. \"The advancement of EB103 into the expansion phase of STARLIGHT-1is a pivotal milestone for Estrella,\" said Cheng Liu, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Estrella. \"The excellent safety profile and a 100% complete response rate observed in the high-dose cohort in Phase I demonstrated EB103's potential to overcome the toxicity barriers that have historically restricted CD19 CAR-T use. We believe EB103 may significantly expand the commercial reach of cell therapy and deliver a best-in-class solution to a broader NHL population, including high-risk subgroups previously ineligible for commercial CAR-T.\" The expansion phase is designed as a multi-center, open-label study intended to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of EB103 at the RP2D in subjects ( 18 years of age) who have R/R B-cell NHL. Data from this expansion cohort will be used to determine the pivotal trial strategy for EB103. Current active sites include UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center and Baylor Scott & White Research Institute. Further details of the trial can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov under NCT identifier: NCT06343311. About EB103 EB103, a T-cell therapy, also referred to as Estrella's \"CD19-Redirected ARTEMIS T-Cell Therapy,\" utilizes ARTEMIS technology licensed from Eureka Therapeutics, Inc. (\"Eureka\"), Estrella's parent company. Unlike a traditional CAR-T cell, the unique design of an ARTEMIS T-Cell, like EB103 T-cell, allows it to be activated and regulated upon engagement with cancer targets that use a cellular mechanism more closely resembling the one from an endogenous T-cell receptor. Once infused, EB103 T cells bind to and destroy CD19-positive cancer cells. About Estrella Immunopharma Estrella is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing CD19 and CD22-targeted ARTEMIS T-cell therapies to treat cancers and autoimmune diseases. Estrella's mission is to harness the evolutionary power of the human immune system to transform the lives of patients fighting cancer and other diseases. To accomplish this mission, Estrella's lead product candidate, EB103, utilizes Eureka's ARTEMIS technology to target CD19, a protein expressed on the surface of almost all B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. Estrella is also developing EB104, which also utilizes Eureka's ARTEMIS technology to target not only CD19, but also CD22, another protein expressed on the surface of most B-cell malignancies.

(Nasdaq: BIOA) (\"BioAge\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutic product candidates for metabolic diseases by targeting the biology of human aging, today announced positive interim data from the ongoing Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) / multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial evaluating BGE-102, a potent, structurally novel, orally available, brain-penetrant small molecule NLRP3 inhibitor being developed for treatment of patients with cardiovascular risk factors. \"We're very encouraged by the interim data from our ongoing Phase 1 trial of BGE-102, an NLRP3 inhibitor with best-in-class potential. Once-daily doses of 60 mg and above were well tolerated and exceeded target IC90 levels in both the periphery and the brain,\" said Kristen Fortney, PhD, CEO and co-founder of BioAge. \"The clear evidence of high brain penetration is especially important, as it supports BGE-102's potential to comprehensively target NLRP3-driven inflammation in both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues.\" Key Initial Findings from the Phase 1 Study Safety & Tolerability BGE-102 treatment was well tolerated across all dose levels evaluated to date in SAD (10, 30, 60, and 120 mg) and MAD (60 and 120 mg) cohorts Adverse events were infrequent and mild to moderate in severity, and all resolved without intervention; full analysis to follow after database lock and unblinding in the first half of 2026 Pharmacokinetics & Pharmacodynamics Dose proportionality observed across doses tested BGE-102 treatment achieved 90% (60 mg dose) to 98% (120 mg dose) suppression of IL-1 production in an ex vivo whole blood stimulation assay prior to dosing on Day 14 In MAD cohorts, treatment with BGE-102 at 60 mg and higher achieved plasma concentrations exceeding IC90 for 24 hours CNS Penetration In MAD cohorts, BGE-102 doses of 60 mg and higher resulted in CSF concentrations exceeding the IC90 after 14 days High brain penetration is a key differentiator from other NLRP3 inhibitors in development, enabling the targeting of both peripheral and central inflammation Phase 1 Study Design The ongoing Phase 1 study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers and obese participants. Part 1 evaluated SAD at four dose levels (10, 30, 60, and 120 mg); Part 2 evaluated MAD administered once daily for 14 days in healthy volunteers (60 mg and 120 mg). Pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated using an ex vivo whole blood stimulation assay that measures BGE-102's ability to inhibit production of the key inflammatory signal IL-1, which is directly downstream of NLRP3. Part 2 has been expanded to evaluate two dose levels in obese participants with elevated hsCRP. The MAD portion in obese participants is ongoing, with data anticipated in the first half of 2026. \"Recent clinical experience has shown that NLRP3 inhibitors can achieve substantial reductions in inflammatory biomarkers such as hsCRP within the first week of treatment,\" said Paul Rubin, MD, Chief Medical Officer of BioAge. \"Because IL-1 is a key upstream regulator of CRP production, the potent and sustained IL-1 suppression we observed with BGE-102 has the potential to translate directly into meaningful effects on hsCRP. As a result, we have expanded the current trial with additional cohorts of obese participants with elevated baseline inflammation with the goal of providing early potential biomarker proof-of-concept.\" Figures and data from the ongoing Phase 1 study are available in the Company's corporate presentation at https://ir.bioagelabs.com/. Anticipated Milestones 1H26: Completion of Phase 1 MAD cohorts in obese participants with elevated hsCRP, evaluating changes in key inflammatory biomarkers including hsCRP and IL-1 : Initiation of Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in patients with obesity and cardiovascular risk factors. The trial is planned to enroll approximately 100 patients randomized 1:1 to placebo or BGE-102 monotherapy for 12 weeks. The anticipated primary endpoint of the trial is percent change in hsCRP. Additionally, the trial will assess a range of inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers, and will include MRI imaging. : Phase 2a data readout Background on BGE-102 and NLRP3 BGE-102 is a potent, orally available, brain-penetrant small molecule NLRP3 inhibitor being developed for cardiovascular risk factors in patients with obesity. BGE-102 represents a structurally novel class of NLRP3 inhibitors developed by BioAge with a unique mechanism binding site . NLRP3 is a key driver of age-related inflammation that has been implicated in a broad range of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative conditions, and metabolic disorders. NLRP3 inhibition is a promising emerging strategy for reducing levels of inflammatory biomarkers associated with cardiovascular risk. About BioAge Labs, Inc.

Following the Transaction, the Company will retain a 49% non-controlling ownership interest in the Partnership, a new standalone joint venture holding the Business, while receiving upfront cash proceeds of approximately $540 million and a $135 million Seller Note (as defined below). non-controlling Restructuring The Transaction will involve the transfer by the Company and its indirect subsidiaries (including Sellers) of certain Business-related entities, assets and liabilities to the Partnership (such transfers and related actions, collectively, the \"Restructuring\") at or prior to consummation of the Transaction (the \"Closing\") pursuant to a steps plan (the \"Restructuring Steps Plan\"). As partial consideration for Sellers' contribution of the Business to the Partnership, the Partnership will issue a promissory note in favor of Middleby Marshall Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in the principal amount of $135 million (the \"Seller Note\"), payable by the Partnership. The Seller Note will be repaid in full before any distributions, other than tax distributions, may be made to the limited partners of the Partnership (including in connection with any transaction where proceeds would otherwise be paid directly to the limited partners, rather than to the Partnership).

At the effective time of the Merger, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Partnership and Buyer Merger Sub (including the proceeds of the loans under the Credit Agreement) will vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Partnership and Buyer Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company. Closing Conditions The Closing is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions, including: (i) the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the Transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (ii) the absence of any law, order, decree or ruling restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the Transaction (a \"Closing Legal Impediment\"), (iii) the accuracy of each party's representations and warranties, subject to certain standards and qualifications as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, (iv) the parties having performed or complied with their respective obligations and covenants set forth in the Purchase Agreement in all material respects, (v) the absence of a material adverse effect on the Partnership or the Business between signing of the Transaction and Closing, (vi) the completion of the Restructuring in accordance with the terms of the Restructuring Steps Plan, (vii) the Contribution Payment being made to MMS or its designee, and (viii) the receipt by Buyer and Sellers, respectively, of certain customary deliverables as set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including evidence of certain lien releases and executed counterparts to certain ancillary agreements which have not been executed and delivered prior to the Closing. Representations, Warranties and Covenants The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of each party, including fundamental representations and warranties made by Sellers regarding title and ownership of the partnership interests of the Partnership to be purchased by Buyer and similar other matters. The representations and warranties of each party set forth in the Purchase Agreement have been made only for purposes of, and were and are solely for the benefit of the parties to, the Purchase Agreement, and investors should not rely on them as statements of fact.

(BUSINESS WIRE) December 4, 2025 The Middleby Corporation (\"Middleby\") (NASDAQ: MIDD) today announced entry into a definitive agreement under which it will sell a 51% stake in its Residential Kitchen business to affiliates of 26North Partners LP (\"26North\") in a transaction valuing Residential Kitchen at $885 million. Following this transaction, Middleby will own a 49% non-controlling interest in a new standalone joint venture holding the Residential Kitchen business, while receiving upfront cash proceeds of approximately $540 million and holding a $135 million seller note provided to the joint venture. The Residential Kitchen business brings together a collection of market-leading, premium residential equipment brands, including Viking, AGA Rangemaster, La Cornue, Kamado Joe, Marvel, Novy and U-Line. This transaction, along with the previously announced spin-off of the Food Processing business that is expected to be completed in H1 2026, marks a significant milestone in Middleby's transformation into a pure-play commercial foodservice leader. As a pure-play commercial foodservice company, Middleby is positioned for higher growth as a leader in automation and innovation, with a comprehensive portfolio of leading commercial foodservice products poised to address attractive market opportunities. Commercial foodservice is focused on delivering customer solutions around labor savings, reducing food costs, and maximizing kitchen efficiencies, while entering new growth markets in ice and beverage. As a standalone company, the commercial foodservice platform has an attractive, best-in-class financial profile with 2024 annual revenue of $2.38 billion, $654 million in Adjusted EBITDA and an Adjusted EBITDA Margin above 27%. Management Comments \"Today's announcement is a definitive step in the evolution of Middleby\" said Tim FitzGerald, President and Chief Executive Officer of Middleby. \"Over the past 12 months, the Middleby team has accelerated our portfolio transformation, including announcing the spin-off of Middleby Food Processing, while investing in organic growth opportunities and returning capital to shareholders.\" \"This transaction enables Middleby to partially monetize the Residential Kitchen business at an attractive valuation and provides significant upfront cash proceeds to invest in shareholder return and growth initiatives, while enabling Middleby to participate in Residential Kitchen's upside potential,\" continued Mr. FitzGerald. \"We are excited to partner with 26North given its successful history of value creation in collaboration with corporate partners. We look forward to working closely with 26North to create a stronger Residential Kitchen business and to ensure continuity for employees and customers.\" \"This investment in the Residential Kitchen business reflects the creative, proprietary and tailored solutions that define how 26North collaborates with corporate partners to unlock value in world-class businesses,\" said Mark Weinberg, Partner and Head of Private Equity at 26North. \"It creates a dedicated platform for the most influential and iconic brands in residential and outdoor cooking, allowing them to continue setting the pace for the industry.\" Residential Kitchen Transaction Details Middleby will retain a noncontrolling common equity stake in the standalone Residential Kitchen business. Residential Kitchen's financial results will be reported as discontinued operations as of Q4 2025 and reported as income from minority interest upon closing. As part of the transaction, Residential Kitchen will be structured as a joint venture between Middleby and 26North. The transaction will be funded by fully committed third-party debt financing, a $135 million seller note provided by Middleby to the joint venture, a preferred equity contribution by 26North and rollover equity by Middleby. About the Previously Announced Spin-Off of Middleby Food Processing Middleby Food Processing enters the market with category-leading brands and a synergistic portfolio of best-in-class end-to-end solutions for industrial protein, bakery and snack processors. As a standalone company, Middleby Food Processing is expected to build upon its strong track record of long-term sales growth and industry-leading margins to drive returns at or above peer levels, unlocking its full value potential. Middleby Food Processing will continue its focus on full-line solutions, further expansion into adjacent markets and launch of new product innovations to continue to bolster a best-in-class growth trajectory. Capitalizing on ongoing growth trends, in 2024, the food processing business achieved $770 million in revenue, $197 million in Adjusted EBITDA and an Adjusted EBITDA Margin above 25%.

(the \"Company\" and \"Cross Country Healthcare\") (Nasdaq: CCRN) today announced the termination of its Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\" and, the transactions contemplated thereby, the \"Aya Merger\") with Aya Holdings II Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Parent\"), Spark Merger Sub One Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\"Merger Sub\"), and, solely for purposes of Section 11.14 thereto, Aya Healthcare, Inc. (\"Aya Healthcare\"). In connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement, Aya Healthcare is required to pay Cross Country Healthcare a termination fee of $20 million. As previously disclosed, the consummation of the Merger Agreement was subject to the satisfaction of a number of closing conditions, including, without limitation, the successful completion of a review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (\"HSR\"). Following a request for additional information (\"Second Request\") from the FTC received on February 20, 2025 by the Company and Aya Healthcare in connection with the Merger Agreement, each of the Company and Aya Healthcare certified to the FTC on August 29, 2025 that they had substantially complied with the Second Request. As a result of discussions with the FTC, the HSR waiting period was initially set to expire on November 17, 2025. In addition, the Merger Agreement end date was extended from September 3, 2025 to December 3, 2025. However, due to the historic 43-day government shutdown, the expiry of the HSR waiting period was extended day-for-day while the shutdown persisted. This resulted in an HSR waiting period end date of December 30, 2025, which exceeded the December 3, 2025 termination date of the Merger Agreement. Cross Country Healthcare's rigorous efforts to advocate for a shortened review period with the FTC were unsuccessful. The Company remained committed to closing the transaction, however it was unable to reach an agreement with Aya Healthcare to amend and extend the Merger Agreement beyond the December 3, 2025 termination date. As justification for abandoning the deal, effective December 4, 2025, Aya Healthcare referenced the uncertainty, time and resource burden resulting from a possible challenge by the FTC. John A. Martins, President and CEO of Cross Country Healthcare, Inc., stated: \"Although the outcome is not what we envisioned, we believe we are well-positioned to continue executing our strategic plan and drive accelerated growth. The Company is operationally resilient, well diversified across the continuum of care and fully focused on delivering long-term value for our shareholders. We are a financially strong, AI driven and tech savvy organization with a strong cash position and no debt. Under our current repurchase program, the Company also has authority to repurchase up to $40 million of its stock from time-to-time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The Company intends to immediately commence repurchases, subject to market conditions. In 2026, we will proudly celebrate 40 years of industry leadership and clinical excellence.\" He continued, \"I am incredibly proud of our team's persistence and professionalism throughout the lengthy FTC review process. Their commitment has only strengthened our momentum. With clarity around our standalone path, we are energized and excited to continue advancing innovation, driving efficiencies, and capturing the significant opportunities ahead.\" About Cross Country Healthcare Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. is a market-leading, tech-enabled workforce solutions and advisory firm with nearly 40 years of industry experience and insight.

(Nasdaq: ATOS) (\"Atossa\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on transforming breast cancer treatment and prevention, announced the completion of a Type C meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") on November 17, 2025, to review regulatory strategy for advancing (Z)-endoxifen. During the meeting, the FDA provided the Company feedback on potential expedited regulatory pathways and development options across metastatic disease, neoadjuvant treatment, and breast cancer risk-reduction settings. The meeting focused on clinical development design, endpoint strategy, and pathways that could support a streamlined registrational approach. Atossa believes the FDA interaction meaningfully clarified potential routes to accelerate clinical development and regulatory review for (Z)-endoxifen, helping to position the Company to pursue a faster and more focused development strategy across multiple breast cancer indications. \"This meeting was a meaningful development milestone for our programs,\" said Steven Quay, M.D., Ph.D., Atossa's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We used this discussion to incorporate FDA feedback into our development planning that could meaningfully shorten our regulatory timeline. We continue to aggressively execute the advancement of (Z)-endoxifen across the breast cancer continuum and toward potential registration pathways.\" This includes multiple high-value clinical settings, including: Metastatic breast cancer (mBC): A dose-ranging study is in preparation as part of the Company's strategy to support registrational development. Neoadjuvant ER+/HER2- breast cancer: Enrollment and data generation continue in the Phase 2 EVANGELINE trial. Breast cancer risk-reduction: Development includes a low-dose strategy targeting mammographic breast density and overall breast cancer risk. In support of its metastatic breast cancer program, Atossa recently submitted an Investigational New Drug application (\"IND\") to the FDA and is awaiting feedback. The Company also anticipates additional IND submissions in 2026 to advance combination strategies and explore opportunities beyond monotherapy and breast cancer. \"Our clinical program is now structured around decisive value-creating milestones,\" said Janet Rea, MSPH, Senior Vice President of Research and Development. \"We have completed multiple clinical trials involving nearly 800 participants, and are optimistic that this foundation, combined with anticipated upcoming data, and FDA input supports an active push towards multiple regulatory endpoints.\" About (Z)-Endoxifen (Z)-endoxifen is a highly potent Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator/Degrader (SERM/D) with demonstrated ability to inhibit and potentially degrade estrogen receptors. It has shown activity even in tumors that have developed resistance to other endocrine therapies. Beyond its anti-estrogenic properties, (Z)-endoxifen also targets the oncogenic signaling pathway, protein kinase C beta 1 (PKC1), at clinically achievable blood and tumor levels. (Z)-endoxifen also seems to deliver comparable or superior bone-protective effects relative to tamoxifen. Atossa is developing a proprietary enteric oral formulation of (Z)-endoxifen that bypasses stomach acid, which would otherwise partially convert the active (Z)-isomer to its inactive (E)-form. We believe this innovation allows for optimal bioavailability and therapeutic integrity. Clinical studies have shown Atossa's (Z)-endoxifen to be well tolerated in both healthy women and those with breast cancer. In nearly 800 adults (healthy volunteers and breast cancer patients) receiving doses up to 360 mg/day, no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified, supporting continued dose-range exploration. Atossa's (Z)-endoxifen program is supported by a growing global intellectual property portfolio, including four recently issued U.S. patents and numerous pending applications worldwide. About Atossa Therapeutics Atossa Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATOS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies in oncology, including (Z)-endoxifen, to improve outcomes for patients across the breast cancer continuum of care.

(the \"Company\" or \"ScanTech AI\") (Nasdaq: STAI), a developer of advanced AI-powered security screening and imaging systems, today announced that following the previously disclosed timely Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Panel\") review request, a hearing before the Panel has been scheduled for January 22, 2026, to appeal the previously disclosed Nasdaq Listing Qualification Staff (\"Staff\") determination regarding delisting. In connection with this process, the suspension and delisting action has been stayed until December 17, 2025, allowing ScanTech AI's common stock to continue to trade on The Nasdaq Global Market during the stay period. The Company has also made an application for an extension to this period to extend until the result of the January 22, 2026 Panel is finalised. This extension is currently being considered by the Panel, with the ability of the Company to file its periodic report on Form 10-Q during the extension period being one of the factors considered by the Panel. Nasdaq Rule 5815(a)(1)(B)(i) states that if a Delisting Determination relates to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) or a delinquent periodic filing, that the automatic stay will be limited to 15 days unless the Company requests for and is granted an extended stay. The Company has previously disclosed that it has filed the amended and restated March 31, 2025 and June 30 periodic filings on Forms 10-Q/A, and believes it is on track to file its September 30, 2025 periodic filing on Form 10-Q within the 15 day stay period. The Company plans to present a comprehensive compliance plan to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel addressing both the MVLS requirements and its recent filing deficiencies. Management remains confident in the Company's ability to demonstrate a clear path to full compliance. However, there can be no assurance that the Company's hearing will be successful, or that, if successful, the Company will be able to maintain compliance with all applicable listing criteria. Business Operations Remain Unaffected The Company reiterated that the Nasdaq process does not impact day-to-day operations, customer commitments, or the Company's ability to execute ongoing strategic initiatives.

Excluding fuel and Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, sales increased 2.6% compared to the same period last year. Gross margin was 22.8% of sales for the third quarter compared to 22.4% for the same period last year. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, Brands performance, lower supply chain costs, and lower shrink, partially offset by the mix effect from growth in pharmacy sales, which has lower margins, and price investments. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding rent, depreciation and amortization, and fuel, increased 49 basis points compared to the same period last year. The improvement in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, Our Brands performance, lower supply chain costs, and lower shrink, partially offset by the mix effect from growth in pharmacy sales, which has lower margins, and price investments. The LIFO charge for the quarter was $44 million, compared to a LIFO charge of $4 million for the same period last year. The Operating, General and Administrative rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 27 basis points compared to the same period last year. The increase in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and investments in associate wages and benefits, partially offset by lower incentive plan costs and improved productivity. Kroger made the decision to make an accelerated contribution to multi-employer pension plans in the third quarter, helping stabilize associates' future benefits and reduce future obligations. The contribution increased this quarter's Operating, General and Administrative rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, by 8 basis points.

The ASR was completed as part of Kroger's $7.5 billion share repurchase authorization. Kroger is executing open market share repurchases under the remaining $2.5 billion authorization. Kroger expects to complete these open market share repurchases by the end of fiscal 2025, which is contemplated in full-year guidance. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.73, compared to 1.21 a year ago (Table 5). The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.30 to 2.50.

Second quarter reported net sales decreased 5% to $1.0 billion (-2% on an organic basis ) compared to the same prior-year period. In the quarter, reported operating income decreased 10% to $305 million (-9% on an organic basis) and diluted earnings per share decreased 14% to $0.47. For the first six months of the fiscal year, the company's reported net sales decreased 4% to $2.0 billion (flat on an organic basis) compared to the same prior-year period. First half reported operating income decreased 9% to $565 million (-4% on an organic basis) and diluted earnings per share decreased 13% to $0.83. Lawson Whiting, Brown-Forman's President and Chief Executive Officer shared, \"Our second quarter results reflect a continuation of the themes we saw in the first quarter, and the first half of the year unfolded largely as we expected. While the operating environment continues to be challenging, our team remains resilient and focused on executing our plans. Based on this performance and our visibility into the remainder of the year, we are pleased to reaffirm our fiscal year guidance.\" First Half of Fiscal 2026 Highlights Net sales decline largely driven by the end of the Korbel Champagne Cellars relationship (Korbel relationship) and the absence of the Sonoma-Cutrer prior-year transition services agreement (TSA). From a geographic perspective, net sales growth in Emerging markets and the Travel Retail channel was more than offset by declines in the United States and Developed International markets. Gross margin expanded basis points driven by the positive effect of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by higher costs and unfavorable price/mix. The Brown-Forman Board of Directors authorized a $400 million share repurchase program and increased the quarterly cash dividend for the 42nd consecutive year. Cash flows from operations grew by $163 million to $292 million and free cash flow increased by $179 million to $236 million. First Half of Fiscal 2026 Brand Results Net sales for Whiskey products were flat (flat organic). The launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Blackberry and higher net sales of Woodford Reserve, driven by distributor inventories and transitions in the United States, were offset by lower volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. Net sales for the Tequila portfolio declined 3% (-3% organic). Herradura's net sales declined 11% (-11% organic) led by lower volumes in the United States as the tequila category remains competitive. el Jimador's net sales increased 1% (+2% organic) driven by higher volumes in Colombia and an estimated net increase in distributor inventories in the United States. Net sales for the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) portfolio increased 5% (+5% organic). Net sales of New Mix increased 28% (+30% organic) fueled by growth in Mexico with market share gains in an accelerating category. Jack Daniel's RTD/RTP portfolio declined 4% (-4% organic) largely due to the absence of American-made beverage alcohol from retail shelves across most provinces in Canada. Rest of Portfolio's net sales declined 35% (+22% organic) driven by the conclusion of the Korbel relationship and the absence of the Sonoma-Cutrer and Finlandia prior-year TSAs. The decline was partially offset by the distribution of new agency brands in Japan and Mexico, along with broad-based growth of Gin Mare. Net sales for non-branded and bulk decreased 61% driven by lower used barrel sales. First Half of Fiscal 2026 Market Results Net sales in the United States decreased 9% (flat organic) driven by the end of the Korbel relationship and the absence of the Sonoma-Cutrer prior-year TSA, as well as lower volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Herradura, and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. These declines were partially offset by the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Blackberry and higher net sales across the portfolio as a result of changes to our distributor relationship terms. In a challenging economic environment, net sales in the Developed International markets declined 4% (-6% organic), though improved sequentially. The decline was driven by the absence of American-made beverage alcohol from retail shelves in most of the Canadian provinces and lower volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in Germany and the United Kingdom. The decline was partially offset by the positive effect of foreign exchange, new agency brands in Japan, and the benefit from transition to owned distribution in Italy. Net sales in Emerging markets increased 10% (+12% organic) led by strong double digit growth of New Mix, higher volumes across the Jack Daniel's family of brands in Brazil and Trkiye, and an estimated net increase in distributor inventories. The Travel Retail channel's net sales increased 7% (+6% organic) due to higher volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, the phasing of ordering patterns, and the positive effect of foreign exchange First Half of Fiscal 2026 Other P&L Items Gross profit decreased 4% (-3% organic). Gross margin expanded 30 basis points to 59.5% driven by the positive effect of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by higher costs and unfavorable price/mix. Advertising expense decreased 2% (-1% organic a more focused investment for the new \"That's What Makes Jack, JACK\" global campaign, the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Blackberry, and the negative effect of foreign exchange was more than offset by lower spend across the rest of our portfolio and the absence of the Korbel brands. ling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased 3% (-4% organic) largely driven by lower compensation-and-benefit-related expenses. The company incurred $16 million in charges related to the strategic restructuring initiative announced in January 2025. Operating income declined 9% (-4% organic) with an operating margin decrease of 150 basis points to 28.9%. The operating margin decrease was primarily driven by the decline in gross profit, the impact of the restructuring initiative, and the absence of the prior-year franchise tax refund. These declines were partially offset by the benefit of the substitution drawback claims The company recognized a non-operating pension settlement charge of $22 million, largely related to the early retirement benefit offered in fiscal 2025. Diluted earnings per share decreased $0.13 driven by the decrease in operating income and an increase in non-operating postretirement expense. First Half of Fiscal 2026 Financial Stewardship On November 19, 2025, the Brown-Forman Board of Directors approved an increase of 2% to the quarterly cash dividend from $0.2265 per share to $0.2310 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock. The dividend is payable on January 2, 2026, to stockholders of record on December 5, 2025. Brown-Forman, a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, has paid regular quarterly cash dividends for 82 consecutive years and has increased the regular dividend for 42 consecutive years. As announced on October 2, 2025, the Brown-Forman Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $400 million (exclusive of brokerage fees and excise taxes) of outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock from October 1, 2025, through October 1, 2026, subject to market and other conditions. As of October 31, 2025, $301 million remained available under the program. In addition, cash flows from operations grew $163 million to $292 million, primarily reflecting disciplined working capital management. Free cash flow increased $179 million to $236 million, reflecting strong operating cash flow generation and lower capital expenditure needs. Fiscal 2026 Outlook We continue to anticipate the operating environment for fiscal 2026 to be challenging, with low visibility due to macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility as we face headwinds from consumer uncertainty and lower non-branded sales of used barrels. We remain focused on building our business for the long term and navigating the current environment at pace with strategic initiatives in fiscal 2026 that we believe will unlock future growth led by the significant evolution of our U.S. distribution, the restructuring initiative, and meaningful new product innovation. Accordingly, we reiterate the following expectation for fiscal 2026: Organic net sales decline in the low-single digit range. Organic operating income decline in the low-single digit range. Our effective tax rate to be in the range of approximately 21% to 23%. The estimated capital expenditures range has been updated to $110 to $120 million from $125 to $135 million.

Both systems underwent additional investigation of afterload sensitivity on the MCT by assessing cardiac output while increasing mean aortic pressure at 125 BPM while maintaining right atrial pressure at 10 mmHg . Further evaluation of the Emperor TAH was conducted in three acute porcine models . Following median sternotomy, cardiectomy, and device implantation, pressure lines were introduced into the atria and the aorta . A Swan - Ganz catheter was placed in the pulmonary artery to monitor flow rates . The device output was assessed for preload sensitivity and afterload independence in all three models by adjusting blood volume via the bypass circuit and vascular resistance via vasopressor administration . (Phenylephrine, 1 - 3 ug/kg/min IV) Figure 4. Emperor Exhibits Afterload Independence In Vitro In vio citoimancc The Emperor TAH demonstrated increased cardiac output at a constant beat rate in response to increased right atrial pressure, indicating effective autoregulation in response to changing hemodynamic conditions . Overall autoregulation was comparable to that of the 50 cc STAH [see Figure 3 ] . The Emperor TAH reproduces the preload sensitivity of the pneumatic SynCardia Total Artificial Heart by replicating its fundamental principle of variable fill volume and full ejection . 6 1 5 4 Cardiac Output (L/min) 3 2 0 125 BPM 4 6 Emperor TAH STAH 8 10 12 Right Atrial Pressure (mmHg) 14 Figure 3. Emperor Exhibits Frank - Starling Autoregulation In Vitro 7 The Emperor TAH demonstrated sustained cardiac output at a constant beat rate in response to increased aortic pressure, demonstrating insensitivity to afterload . This performance reproduces the afterload independence of the pneumatic SynCardia Total Artificial Heart, as shown in Figure 4 . As a volume displacement pump, the STAH provides consistent flow against variable outflow pressures . The Emperor TAH, by replicating its mechanism of action, exhibits the same degreeof afterload independence . In vivo citoimancc We report the first in vivo implantation of the Emperor TAH in a porcine model, conducted to assess surgical feasibility, hemodynamic performance, and anatomical compatibility during acute support . The evaluation aimed to confirm that the proven SynCardia blood - contacting system maintains physiologic performance when driven by the new electromechanical actuation platform .. Discussion In vitro testing showed that the Emperor TAH maintained constant cardiac output across increasing aortic pressures, demonstrating afterload independence equivalent to the pneumatic SynCardia Total Artificial Heart (Figure 4 ) . As a volume - displacement pump with identical chamber geometry, diaphragm, and valve architecture, the Emperor TAH replicates the STAH ' s characteristic insensitivity to outflow pressure . Acute in vivo implantation further confirmed stable support and hemodynamic equivalence to the pneumatic platform, validating physiologic performance under electromechanical drive . These results reinforce the reliability of the shared blood - contacting architecture and establish a solid foundation for chronic large - animal studies and future clinical translation . Pcitoimancc Acute in vivo testing demonstrated stable support and hemodynamic equivalence to the pneumatic STAH, confirming that the Emperor TAH maintains the physiologic performance of the shared chamber, diaphragm, and valve system . 2025 Intiouction The SynCardia Total Artificial Heart (STAH) is a clinically proven and highly effective treatment for end - stage biventricular heart failure . 1 With over 2 , 100 implants, it remains the only commercially available and FDA - approved total artificial heart on the market . The STAH provides robust and stable circulatory support, enabled by its pneumatic actuation system, which offers a broad range of autoregulation and afterload independence . 2 SynCardia is developing the Emperor Total Artificial Heart (Emperor TAH), a motor - driven evolution of the SynCardia STAH that preserves the proven blood - contacting architecture while replacing the external pneumatic driver with a compact electromechanical system . The device consists of two 50 cc STAH ventricles integrated with a novel mechanical actuation system engineered to replicate STAH physiology, enable full mobility, and serve as the foundation for a fully implantable platform . To validate functional continuity, we evaluated autoregulation equivalence between the pneumatic STAH and the mechanically driven Emperor TAH . All blood - contacting surfaces the pumping chamber geometry, polyurethane diaphragm, Syn - Hall inflow and outflow valves are identical to the FDA - approved SynCardia Total Artificial Heart . Only the actuation mechanism has been modernized from pneumatic to motor - driven pusher plate motion . This design preserves established biocompatibility, hemocompatibility, and flow performance while enabling next - generation implantability . Clinical durability of the legacy platform is well demonstrated, including a patient exceeding eight years of continuous TAH support, underscoring the robustness of the shared chamber, diaphragm, and valve system . 2 1 0 5 4 Cardiac Output (L/min) 3 80 125 BPM 85 Emperor TAH STAH RAP: 10 mmHg 90 95 100 Mean Aortic Pressure (mmHg) 105 110 A B STAH Emperor TAH C D 2A.

Accordingly, the representations and warranties may not describe the actual state of affairs at the date they were made or at any other time, and investors should not rely on them as statements of fact. In addition, such representations and warranties (1) will not survive consummation of the Merger, and (2) were made only as of the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date as is specified in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the parties' public disclosures. Accordingly, the Merger Agreement is included with this filing only to provide investors with information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement, and not to provide investors with any factual information regarding Associated or American National, their respective affiliates or their respective businesses. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding Associated, American National, their respective affiliates or their respective businesses, the Merger Agreement and the Merger that will be contained in, or incorporated by reference into, the registration statement on Form S-4 that will include a prospectus of Associated, as well as in the Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings that Associated makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Transfer, Voting and Registration Rights Agreement Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the voting shareholders of American National have entered into a Transfer, Voting and Registration Rights Agreement (the \"Shareholders' Agreement\") pursuant to which, among other things, each American National voting shareholder delivered its executed written consent to adopt the Merger Agreement, agreed to comply with certain transfer restrictions with respect to the Associated Common Stock they will receive in the Merger and agreed, subject to limited exceptions, to vote their shares of Associated Common Stock in accordance with the recommendation of the Associated board of directors, and Associated agreed to register such shares of Associated Common Stock on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Shareholders' Agreement. The transfer restrictions prohibit transfers of Associated Common Stock in the first sixty days following the completion of the merger and, for the remainder of the period through the first anniversary, among other things, limits the public sale of shares to 150,000 shares per day (unless pursuant to a broadly distributed underwritten offering). The transfer and voting obligations will terminate at such time when the former American National voting shareholders cease to hold at least 5% of outstanding Associated voting securities, and each such shareholder's registration rights will terminate once such shareholder no longer holds any registrable securities of Associated. The foregoing description of the Shareholders' Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Shareholders' Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

The Agreement provides that the Acquisition is intended to be structured as a private placement exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. As part of the Agreement, the Company has agreed to grant certain registration rights to the Seller with respect to the Buyer Shares and any Warrant Shares. The Company is obligated to file a registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") to register the resale of the Buyer Shares and Warrant Shares promptly following the closing of the Acquisition. The Pre-Funded Warrants, if issued, will be exercisable immediately upon issuance and will remain exercisable until exercised in full, subject to customary adjustments. The closing of the Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including the accuracy of representations and warranties, performance of covenants, receipt of necessary consents and approvals, absence of material adverse effects, and other conditions set forth in the Agreement.

Amendment No. 1 to License Agreement with Paragon Therapeutics, Inc. On December 2, 2025, Crescent OpCo entered into Amendment No. 1 (the \"Amendment\") to the License Agreement, dated April 28, 2025, by and between Crescent OpCo and Paragon Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \"Paragon License\"), relating to CR-001. The purpose of the Amendment was to amend certain terms of the Paragon License for the sole purpose of accommodating and aligning with the sublicense for the CR-001 License Agreement with Kelun-Biotech. The foregoing summary of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein. Private Placement On December 4, 2025, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") for a private placement (the \"Private Placement\") with certain institutional and other accredited investors (each, a \"Purchaser\" and collectively, the \"Purchasers\"). The closing of the Private Placement (the \"Closing\") is expected to occur on December 8, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers agreed to purchase an aggregate of 13,795,685 ordinary shares with a par value of US$0.001 per share of the Company (the \"Ordinary Shares\"), at a purchase price per share of $13.41 (or, for certain investors in lieu of Ordinary Shares, pre-funded warrants (the \"Pre-Funded Warrants\") to purchase shares of Ordinary Shares (the \"Pre-Funded Warrant Shares\"), at a purchase price per underlying Pre-Funded Warrant Share of $13.409, which represents the per share purchase price of the Ordinary Shares less the $0.001 per share exercise price for each Pre-Funded Warrant), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $185.0 million. The Pre-Funded Warrants will be exercisable at any time after the date of issuance. A holder of Pre-Funded Warrants may not exercise the warrant if the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own more than 9.99% of the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. A holder of Pre-Funded Warrants may increase or decrease this percentage to a percentage not in excess of 19.99% by providing at least 61 days' prior notice to the Company. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the Company, on the one hand, and the Purchasers, on the other hand, and customary conditions to closing. Based on the Company's current plans, the Company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the net proceeds from the Private Placement, will be sufficient to fund its operations and capital expenditure requirements into 2028. Also on December 4, 2025, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\") with the Purchasers, which provides that the Company will register the resale of the Ordinary Shares and the Pre-Funded Warrant Shares. The Company is required to prepare and file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than 30 days after the date of the Closing, and to use its reasonable best efforts to have the registration statement declared effective within 60 days thereafter, subject to certain exceptions. The Company has also agreed to, among other things, indemnify the Purchasers, their officers, directors, agents, partners, members, managers, stockholders, affiliates, investment advisers and employees under the registration statement from certain liabilities and pay all fees and expenses (excluding any legal fees of the selling holder(s), and any underwriting discounts and selling commissions) incident to the Company's obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement. The securities issued and sold to the Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, or under any state securities laws. The Company relied on this exemption from registration based in part on representations made by the Purchasers. The securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Neither this Current Report on Form 8-K, nor the exhibits attached hereto, is an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein. The Company engaged Jefferies LLC, TD Securities (USA) LLC, Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Wedbush & Co., LLC as placement agents for the Private Placement, and Piper Sandler & Co. served as financial advisor for the Private Placement. The Company has agreed to pay customary placement agent and financial advisory fees and reimburse certain expenses of the placement agents.

Crescent will receive an upfront payment of US$20 million from Kelun-Biotech and is also eligible to receive additional milestones of up to US$30 million, plus tiered low to middle single digit royalties on net sales of CR-001. About CR-001 (also known as SKB118) CR-001 is a tetravalent bispecific antibody being developed for the treatment of solid tumors that combines two complementary, validated mechanisms in oncology via a blockade of PD-1 and VEGF. PD-1 checkpoint inhibition is aimed at restoring T cells' ability to recognize and destroy tumor cells, and blocking VEGF is intended for reducing blood supply to tumor cells and inhibiting tumor growth. In preclinical studies, CR-001 demonstrated cooperative pharmacology with increased binding to PD-1 and signal blockade in the presence of VEGF as well as robust anti-tumor activity. CR-001's anti-VEGF activity may also normalize the vasculature at the tumor site, which has the potential to improve the localization and effectiveness of combination therapies, such as the administration of CR-001 with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). A global Phase 1/2 trial of CR-001 in patients with solid tumors is anticipated to commence in the first quarter of 2026. About SKB105 (also known as CR-003) SKB105 is a differentiated ADC targeting integrin beta-6 (ITGB6) with a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload. ITGB6 is overexpressed in many solid tumors, but shows minimal to no expression in most normal tissues, thereby potentially reducing the risk of systemic toxicity and off-target effects. SKB105 consists of an anti-ITGB6 fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated via a stable, clinically validated cleavable linker. The molecule incorporates proprietary Kthiol irreversible conjugation technology, designed to enhance stability and tumor-specific payload delivery while reducing adverse effects. SKB105 demonstrated a favorable efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in preclinical models. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial of SKB105 in patients with solid tumors is anticipated to commence in the first quarter of 2026. About Kelun-Biotech Kelun-Biotech (6990.HK) is a holding subsidiary of Kelun Pharmaceutical (002422.SZ), which focuses on the R&D, manufacturing, commercialization and global collaboration of innovative biological drugs and small molecule drugs.

Additionally, the financing we announced today with leading healthcare investors strengthens our balance sheet, providing anticipated cash runway through multiple key inflection points. Our comprehensive update today underscores Crescent's commitment to deliver on our vision of building the next leading biotech oncology company.\" Kelun-Biotech and Crescent Strategic Partnership In a separate release today, Kelun-Biotech and Crescent announced a strategic partnership to develop and commercialize next generation oncology therapeutics, including novel combinations. The partnership involves Crescent's CR-001, a PD-1 x VEGF bispecific antibody, and Kelun-Biotech's SKB105 (also known as CR-003), an integrin beta-6 (ITGB6)-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with a topoisomerase payload. Under the terms of the collaboration, Crescent has granted Kelun-Biotech exclusive rights to research, develop, and commercialize CR-001 in Greater China (including mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) . In addition, Kelun-Biotech has granted Crescent exclusive rights to research, develop, and commercialize SKB105 (CR-003) in the United States, Europe and all markets outside of Greater China. The partnership includes the development of these candidates as monotherapies, and also the evaluation of CR-001 in combination with SKB105 (CR-003). Both Crescent and Kelun-Biotech have the right to independently develop CR-001 in additional combinations, including combinations of CR-001 with proprietary ADC pipeline assets. Key Pipeline Updates New details on Crescent's portfolio, including the clinical development plan for CR-001 as well as supporting preclinical data and plans for its ADC programs, will be shared during today's conference call and webcast. CR-001, a PD-1 x VEGF bispecific antibody CR-001 is a tetravalent bispecific antibody being developed for the treatment of solid tumors that combines two complementary, validated mechanisms in oncology via a blockade of PD-1 and VEGF. It was intentionally designed to replicate the cooperative pharmacology of ivonescimab, which demonstrated superior efficacy results compared to the current market leader, pembrolizumab, in a large, third-party Phase 3 trial in non-small cell lung cancer. Because of this similar cooperativity, there is the opportunity for rapid and efficient clinical development for CR-001 as Crescent pursues both first-in-class and fast-follower solid tumor indications. Crescent is on track to initiate a global Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CR-001 in patients with solid tumors in the first quarter of 2026. The trial is designed to enroll both treatment-nave and previously-treated patients with multiple solid tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer and various gastrointestinal and gynecological tumors. The trial plans to include dose-escalation, back-fill and dose-optimization cohorts to enable robust assessment of the clinical profile of CR-001. Crescent anticipates reporting proof-of-concept clinical data from the Phase 1/2 trial of CR-001 in the first quarter of 2027, including safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and early anti-tumor activity. CR-001's anti-VEGF activity may normalize the vasculature at the tumor site, which has the potential to improve the localization and effectiveness of combination therapies, such as the planned administration of CR-001 with ADCs. The partnership with Kelun-Biotech accelerates the scope and number of combination studies planned with CR-001 as a potential foundational immuno-oncology backbone. Crescent plans to evaluate CR-001 in combination with multiple ADCs, including CR-002 and CR-003 (SKB105), with initial combination data expected by year-end 2027. CR-002, topoisomerase inhibitor ADC targeting PD-L1 CR-002 is a topoisomerase inhibitor ADC directed to PD-L1, a validated target known to have high expression in multiple solid tumors. CR-002 incorporates a PD-L1 antibody selected for high internalization to facilitate payload release in target cells and a linker designed for intracellular cleavage and high stability in circulation. Crescent is on track to submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for CR-002 in mid-2026 to support the initiation of a Phase 1/2 trial in solid tumors in the second half of 2026, with proof-of-concept data expected in the second half of 2027. CR-003 (SKB105), topoisomerase inhibitor ADC targeting Integrin beta-6 CR-003 (SKB105), discovered by Kelun-Biotech, is a topoisomerase inhibitor ADC directed to integrin beta-6 (ITGB6), which is overexpressed in many solid tumors with minimal expression in most normal tissues. CR-003 (SKB105) consists of an anti-ITGB6 fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated via a stable, clinically validated cleavable linker. CR-003 (SKB105) demonstrated a favorable efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in preclinical models. Kelun-Biotech plans to initiate a Phase 1/2 trial of CR-003 (SKB105) in Greater China in the first quarter of 2026, with proof-of-concept data expected in the first quarter of 2027. A combination study of CR-003 and CR-001 is planned to initiate in the first half of 2027 with initial data anticipated by year-end 2027. Pipeline Expansion Opportunities Crescent also continues to pursue opportunities to advance its strategy in immuno-oncology and best-in-class ADC combinations through internal efforts and with leading partners, including Kelun-Biotech and Paragon Therapeutics.

(Nasdaq: MPLT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of patients suffering from debilitating central nervous system disorders, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2025 and highlighted recent progress and upcoming milestones. \"2025 was a year of exceptional execution and acceleration for MapLight,\" said Chris Kroeger, Chief Executive Officer of MapLight Therapeutics. \"In the last year, we have made noteworthy progress across our entire product candidate portfolio, including the initiation of the Phase 2 ZEPHYR and VISTA studies for ML-007C-MA, completion of enrollment in our Phase 2 IRIS study of ML-004 and advancement of our preclinical programs. With a strengthened balance sheet following our recent public offering, we are in a strong financial position to continue this momentum to advance our broad and diversified pipeline of potentially best-in-class therapies for CNS disorders.\" Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones The Company continued to make significant progress across its pipeline of novel drug candidates with potential to address a breadth of debilitating CNS disorders. ML-007C-MA (M Muscarinic Agonist) for the Treatment of Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease Psychosis (ADP): Topline results from Phase 2 ZEPHYR trial for schizophrenia expected in the second half of 2026. ZEPHYR is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm trial evaluating once- and twice-daily doses of ML-007C-MA for the treatment of hospitalized adult participants with schizophrenia experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychosis. The Company expects to enroll 300 participants in the trial, and the primary endpoint is the change from baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at Week 5. Topline results from Phase 2 VISTA trial for ADP expected in the second half of 2027. VISTA is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial evaluating twice-daily doses of ML-007C-MA for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with ADP. The Company expects to enroll 300 participants in the trial, and the primary endpoint is the change from baseline in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Clinician Hallucinations and Delusions (NPI-C H+D) score at Week 7. ML-004 (5-HT 1B/1D Agonist) for the Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): The Company has completed enrollment in the IRIS Phase 2 study, with topline results expected in the second half of 2026. The IRIS study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-arm trial evaluating once-daily ML-004 for the improvement of core social communication deficits, with change in irritability symptoms as a key secondary endpoint. The trial randomized approximately 160 adult and adolescent participants. ML-021 (M Antagonist) for the Treatment of Motor Deficits in Parkinson's Disease: The Company expects to complete IND-enabling studies for ML-021 in the second half of 2026. ML-009 (GPR52 Positive Allosteric Modulator) for the Treatment of Hyperactivity, Impulsivity and Agitation-Related Disorders: The Company has nominated a development candidate for advancement to IND-enabling studies. Completed $296.5 Million Initial Public Offering and Private Placement: In October 2025, the Company completed its initial public offering (IPO) and concurrent private placement and sold 17,439,207 shares of common stock in aggregate (which included the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares) at a price of $17.00 per share. The net proceeds to the Company were $269.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, placement agent fees, and estimated offering expenses. Third Quarter 2025 Financial Results The Company ended the quarter with $227.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company expects that its current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with the net proceeds from the IPO and concurrent private placement, will be sufficient to fund operations through 2027. Research and development expenses were $27.1 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $16.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. The increase primarily reflects increases in clinical trial expenses, employee-related expenses and formulation and CMC expenses that were partially offset by decreases in preclinical program expenses. General and administrative expenses were $4.4 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases in legal and consulting fees that were partially offset by lower employee-related expenses. Net loss was $29.4 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $19.0 million for the third quarter of 2024.

Because Denali submitted a filing of its intent to request a PRV after the initial BLA submission, based on discussions with the FDA, the Company may not be eligible to receive the PRV. Therefore, Denali is not including any potential future proceeds from the sale of a PRV in its financial planning.

DNL952 (ETV:GAA) Pompe Disease The Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") application for the Phase 1 study of DNL952 has been placed on clinical hold. The FDA requested a protocol amendment to include a lower starting dose, revised inclusion criteria, certain safety monitoring commitments, and stopping rules. These requests are related to preclinical hypersensitivity reactions observed in GAA mouse models, which are commonly observed across all GAA enzyme replacement therapies in mice. The FDA did not request additional nonclinical studies. Denali has submitted a response to the FDA, and pending FDA feedback, anticipates minimal delays in the initiation of the Phase 1 study. As part of our global development strategy for DNL952, Denali is on track to submit a Clinical Trial Application (\"CTA\") in Europe in the first half of 2026.

Actual results may differ from these preliminary results, and such differences may be material. Final results will be reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2025. Financial Highlights (Preliminary, Unaudited) Total net revenue for fiscal 2025 is expected to be between $9.7 million and $9.9 million, compared to $6.4 million in fiscal 2024, an increase of approximately 54%. Gross margin for fiscal 2025 is expected to be in the range of 50.2% to 50.5%, compared to 39.6% in fiscal 2024, an improvement of approximately 10.6%. Loss from operations for fiscal 2025 is expected to be in the range of $37.7 million to $37.8 million, compared to $46.4 million in fiscal 2024. Loss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2025 is expected to be in the range of $7.2 million to $7.3 million, compared to $11.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Adjusted loss from operations for fiscal 2025 is expected to be in the range of $8.5 million to $8.6 million, compared to $16.0 million in fiscal 2024, an improvement of approximately 47%.

Company believes that its year-end cash balance, together with anticipated cash flows and available financing arrangements, provide an improved liquidity position as it executes on its operating plan. of Non-GAAP Financial Measures addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including: Adjusted Gross Profit, which is defined as GAAP Gross Profit excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory write-offs and stock-based compensation expense; and Adjusted Loss from Operations, which is defined as GAAP Loss from Operations excluding depreciation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, merger and acquisition-related expenses, inventory write-offs and stock-based compensation expense. Company's management believes it is useful to consider these non-GAAP financial measures, together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, as they provide more transparency into current business trends, exclusive of the effects of certain non-cash expenses, acquisition-related charges, and items that may not be present in comparative fiscal periods. Management believes that, when considered together with reported GAAP financial measures, these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and management in understanding the Company's ongoing operations and operating trends and in analyzing the Company's underlying financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies. In the future, Mobix may consider whether other items should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures it uses. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional useful information to measure Mobix Labs' financial and operating performance. In particular, these measures facilitate comparison of our operating performance between periods and may help investors to understand better our operating results. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's operating results and in planning and forecasting. reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure will be provided in financial tables to be released separately but concurrently with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2025. The Company has not provided a GAAP reconciliation in this press release as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items such as stock-based compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. The Form 10-K will include the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and additional information about its fiscal 2025 results.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "positive", "score": 0.9976083040237427}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9989171028137207}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995848536491394}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9982008934020996}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9980378746986389}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9949758052825928}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9955098628997803}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9975306391716003}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9636045098304749}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9982990622520447}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999612033367157}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999603807926178}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996088147163391}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995817542076111}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995712637901306}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995539784431458}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994592070579529}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995321035385132}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996196031570435}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996497631072998}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9947677850723267}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9977260231971741}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994410872459412}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995895028114319}], "sentiment": "positive"}], "overall_sentiment": "positive", "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": null}, "000143774925036852": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1113809/000143774925036852/bbw20251203_8k.htm", "filing_date": "Thu, 4 Dec 2025 07:00:26 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": true, "ticker": "BBW", "items": {"item 2.02": {"text": "Results of Operations and Financial Condition On December 4, 2025, Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc.

LOUIS, MO (December 4, 2025) Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (NYSE: BBW) today announced results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 ended November 1, 2025. Total revenues were a third-quarter record $122.7 million, compared to $119.4 million, and for the first nine months, total revenues were also a record $375.3 million, compared to $346.0 million Pre-tax income for the third quarter was $10.7 million, compared to $13.1 million, with an approximate $4 million tariff and related cost impact, and for the first nine months, pre-tax income was $45.7 million, compared to $39.7 million, with an approximate $5 million tariff and related cost impact Third-quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.62, compared with $0.73, and nine-month diluted earnings per share of $2.73, compared with $2.20 Through the first nine months of fiscal 2025, the Company returned $26.1 million to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends The Company reaffirms its guidance for fiscal 2025 \"We are pleased to report record third-quarter and first-nine-months revenue, driven by continued strong store performance in our Direct-to-Consumer segment, and double-digit revenue growth for our Commercial segment. These achievements were further reinforced by opening over 50 net new units on a year-to-date basis, inclusive of our entry into seven additional countries. Based on this, and our continued momentum, we are reaffirming guidance for the year,\" commented Sharon Price John, President and Chief Executive Officer of Build-A-Bear Workshop. \"Looking ahead, we remain focused on advancing our long-term strategic initiatives, particularly the global expansion of our partner-operated model, while continuing to navigate a dynamic economic environment,\" concluded Ms. John. Voin Todorovic, Chief Financial Officer of Build-A-Bear Workshop, added, \"The Company's most profitable first nine months in our history underscore the durability of our evolved and diversified business model as well as the ability to execute our strategic plan. While the Company preemptively mitigated significant tariff impacts during the first half of the year, the third quarter marked the first meaningful expenses from tariffs and related costs. We expect this elevated level of impact to continue through the fourth quarter and into the next fiscal year. Nevertheless, we remain confident in our guidance, which accounts for tariff impacts and our focus on disciplined expense management.\" Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results (13 weeks ended November 1, 2025, compared to the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2024) Total revenues were $122.7 million and increased 2.7%. Net retail sales were $112.3 million and increased 2.5%. Consolidated e-commerce demand (online orders fulfilled from either the Company's warehouses or its stores) decreased 10.8%. Commercial and International franchising segment revenues were a combined $10.4 million and increased 4.9%. Pre-tax income was $10.7 million, or 8.7% of total revenues, compared to $13.1 million, or 11.0% of total revenues, in the prior-year quarter. The $2.4 million decline reflects approximately $4 million in tariffs and related costs. The 230-basis-point reduction in pre-tax margin reflects a 40-basis-point decrease in gross margin, driven by a decline in Retail and Commercial gross margins, primarily due to the impact of tariffs, and a 180-basis-point increase in selling, general and administration (\"SG&A\") expense, from higher store-level compensation, timing of marketing expenses, and general inflationary pressures. Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $0.62, decreased by 15.1%, reflecting lower pre-tax income, partially offset by a lower income tax rate, and a reduction in share count. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") of $14.2 million, decreased by 14.6%, and represented 11.6% of total revenues. Nine-Month Fiscal 2025 Results (39 weeks ended November 1, 2025, compared to the 39 weeks ended November 2, 2024) Total revenues were $375.3 million and increased 8.5%. Net retail sales were $346.5 million and increased 8.0%. Consolidated e-commerce demand (online orders fulfilled from either the Company's warehouses or its stores) decreased 0.7%. Commercial and International franchising segment revenues were a combined $28.8 million and increased 14.7%. Pre-tax income was $45.7 million, or 12.2% of total revenues, compared to $39.7 million, or 11.5% of total revenues, in the prior year. The $6.0 million profit expansion includes approximately $5 million in tariffs and related costs. The 70-basis-point improvement in pre-tax margin reflects a 180-basis-point improvement in total gross margin driven by expansion in Retail gross margin from reduced promotional activity, leverage of fixed costs, and selective price increases, partially offset by the impact of tariffs, and a 110-basis-point increase in SG&A expense, due to higher store-level compensation, corporate costs, and general inflationary pressures. Diluted EPS of $2.73, increased by 24.1%, reflecting higher pre-tax income, a lower income tax rate, and a reduction in share count. EBITDA of $56.1 million, increased by 12.5%, and represented 15.0% of total revenues. Store Activity For the quarter, the Company had net new unit growth of 24 global experience locations, comprised of seven corporately-managed, 11 partner-operated, and six franchise locations. At the end of the third quarter, Build-A-Bear had 651 locations across its corporately-managed, partner-operated, and franchise business models. Globally, this reflects 375 corporately-managed, 168 partner-operated, and 108 franchise locations. Balance Sheet At third-quarter end, cash and cash equivalents totaled $27.7 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 4.2%, compared to third-quarter end last year. The Company finished the quarter with no borrowings under its revolving credit facility. For the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2025, capital expenditures totaled $6.5 million and $12.9 million, respectively. Inventory at quarter-end totaled $83.3 million, an increase of $12.5 million, or 17.7%, compared to third-quarter end last year, primarily driven by the added cost of tariffs and the pull-forward of products aligned with our tariff-mitigation plans. The Company remains comfortable with the level and composition of its inventory. Return of Capital to Shareholders For the third quarter, the Company utilized $10.1 million in cash to repurchase 168,456 shares of its common stock and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $2.9 million to shareholders. For the first nine months of fiscal 2025, the Company utilized $17.4 million in cash to repurchase 336,041 shares of its common stock and paid $8.7 million in quarterly cash dividends to shareholders. Since the end of the third quarter through December 3, the Company has utilized $2.1 million in cash to repurchase an additional 41,551 shares of its common stock. The Company has $69.7 million remaining under the board-authorized $100.0 million stock repurchase program adopted on September 11, 2024. 2025 Outlook The Company reaffirms its 2025 revenue, pre-tax income, and net-new-unit guidance. Specifically, the Company continues to expect: Total revenues to grow on a mid-to-high-single-digit percentage basis Pre-tax income in the range of $62 million to $70 million, reflecting approximately $11 million of tariffs and related costs during the seven months from July through the end of the fiscal year Net-new-unit growth of at least 60 experience locations through a combination of corporately-managed, partner-operated, and franchise business models In addition, for fiscal 2025, the Company continues to expect: Capital expenditures in the range of $20 million to $25 million Depreciation and amortization to approximate $16 million The income tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%, excluding discrete items The Company's guidance considers various factors, including tariffs, medical and labor costs, changes in freight expense, and ongoing inflationary challenges. Additionally, the Company's outlook does not contemplate any further material changes in tariffs, the macroeconomic or geopolitical environment, or relevant foreign currency exchange rates. Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this press release, the Company's financial results are provided both in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and using certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, the Company provides historic income adjusted to exclude certain costs, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These results are included as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP because management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in the Company's business and provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results. These measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. These non-GAAP financial measures are defined and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure later in this document.

REPORTS FISCAL 2026 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS --Top and Bottom-line Results in Line with Lower End of Our Expectations-- -- Journeys Comparable Sales Increased 6%, Overall Comparable Sales Increased 3%-- --Fifth Consecutive Quarter of Positive Comparable Sales Growth -- NASHVILLE, Tenn., Dec. 4, 2025 --- Genesco Inc. (NYSE: GCO) today reported third quarter results for the three months ended November 1, 2025. Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Summary Net sales of $616 million increased 3% compared to Q3FY25 Comparable sales increased 3%, with stores up 5% E-commerce sales represented 23% of retail sales Selling and administrative expenses leveraged 140 basis points compared to last year GAAP EPS was $0.51 and Non-GAAP EPS was $0.79 versus GAAP EPS of ($1.76) and Non-GAAP EPS of $0.61 last year Revises fourth quarter and full year outlook Mimi E. Vaughn, Genesco's Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"We delivered another quarter of top and bottom-line growth, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales increases. The third quarter demonstrated the power of our strategic initiatives, with Journeys delivering strong double-digit comp growth during back-to-school on top of double-digit growth last year. This performance reinforces that when consumers shop for footwear, they are increasingly choosing Journeys, underscoring the momentum of our product elevation and diversification strategy as we continue to gain market share and establish ourselves as the destination for the style-led teen.\" Vaughn continued, \"We experienced a meaningful pullback in the back half of the third quarter, as consumers retreated following the back-to-school season when there was less of a reason to shop. Our sales trends improved during the important Black Friday / Cyber Monday period, contributing to a positive start to the fourth quarter.\" __________________________ Excludes charges for store restructuring, severance and asset impairments, net of tax effect in the third quarter of Fiscal 2026 (\"Excluded Items\"). A reconciliation of earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") with the adjusted earnings and earnings per share numbers is set forth on Schedule B to this press release. The Company believes that disclosure of earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations adjusted for the items not reflected in the previously announced expectations will be meaningful to investors, especially in light of the impact of such items on the results. \"That said, there are some factors causing us to moderate our view on the remainder of the year in spite of our current momentum. We have materially changed our sales and margin projections for Schuh to reflect the ongoing difficult U.K. market and performance. We have also moderated the growth assumptions for our other businesses based on the lower footwear consumer traffic and spending patterns we've recently witnessed on non-peak shopping days.\" Sandra Harris, Genesco's Senior Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer, added, \"Based primarily on the margin pressure at Schuh and our more cautious view on sales, we are revising our full year outlook and now expect adjusted earnings per share of approximately $0.95. We remain focused on tight cost control to offset some of this pressure and strong execution as we navigate these trends.\" Vaughn added, \"Looking ahead to next year, we are excited to build on the progress of Journeys' strategic plan and apply the learnings from our work to drive improved performance at Schuh. We feel confident that our footwear focused strategy will fuel top-line growth with accelerating profitability over the near- and long-term.\" Third Quarter Review Net sales for the third quarter of Fiscal 2026 increased 3% to $616 million compared to $596 million in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. The net sales increase reflects a 5% increase in same store sales, an increase in wholesale sales and a favorable foreign exchange impact, partially offset by the impact of net store closings and a 3% decrease in e-commerce comparable sales. Comparable Sales Comparable Same Store and E-commerce Sales: 3QFY26 3QFY25 Journeys Group Schuh Group Johnston & Murphy Group Total Genesco Comparable Sales Same Store Sales Comparable E-commerce Sales The overall sales increase of 3% for the third quarter of Fiscal 2026 compared to the third quarter of Fiscal 2025 was driven by an increase of 4% at Journeys, an increase of 2% at Schuh, a 3% increase at Johnston & Murphy and a 3% increase at Genesco Brands. On a constant currency basis, Schuh sales were down 1% for the third quarter this year. Gross margin for the third quarter this year was 46.8% compared to 47.8% last year. The 100 basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales compared to Fiscal 2025 is due primarily to lower margins at Genesco Brands Group related to ongoing tariff pressure and the exit of licenses as well as increased promotional activity at Schuh, partially offset by lower shipping and warehouse costs for Journeys and Schuh. Selling and administrative expenses for the third quarter this year of 44.7% decreased 140 basis points as a percentage of sales from 46.1% last year reflecting our cost savings initiatives, primarily decreased occupancy, freight and performance-based compensation expenses. Genesco's GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $8.6 million, or 1.4% of sales this year, compared with $10.2 million, or 1.7% of sales in the third quarter last year. Adjusted for the Excluded Items in the third quarters of both Fiscal 2026 and 2025, operating income for the third quarter was $12.9 million this year compared to $10.3 million last year. Adjusted operating margin was 2.1% of sales in the third quarter of Fiscal 2026 compared to 1.7% in the third quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.1% in Fiscal 2026 compared to 311.5% in the third quarter last year. The adjusted tax rate, reflecting Excluded Items, was 28.9% in Fiscal 2026 compared to 27.1% in the third quarter last year. The higher adjusted tax rate for the third quarter this year compared to the third quarter last year reflects a higher expected tax rate for Fiscal 2026 versus Fiscal 2025 due to the impact of the valuation allowance in certain jurisdictions and additional global minimum tax under the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Pillar Two framework. The divergence between the effective tax rate and the adjusted tax rate is due to income tax law changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\") in Fiscal 2026 and recording a $26.3 million U.S. valuation allowance in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025, both of which we have excluded from the adjusted tax rate in Fiscal 2026 and 2025. GAAP earnings from continuing operations were $5.4 million in the third quarter of Fiscal 2026 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $18.8 million in the third quarter last year. Adjusted for the Excluded Items, third quarter earnings from continuing operations were $8.4 million, or $0.79 per share, in Fiscal 2026, compared to $6.6 million, or $0.61 per share, in the third quarter last year. Cash, Borrowings and Inventory Cash as of November 1, 2025 was $27.0 million, compared with $33.6 million as of November 2, 2024. Total debt at the end of the third quarter of Fiscal 2026 was $89.5 million compared with $100.1 million at the end of last year's third quarter. Inventories increased 7% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting increased inventory at Journeys, Schuh and Johnston & Murphy, partially offset by decreased inventory at Genesco Brands. Capital Expenditures and Store Activity For the third quarter this year, capital expenditures were $18 million, related primarily to retail stores and other initiatives. Depreciation and amortization was $13 million. During the quarter, the Company opened four stores and closed 12 stores. The Company ended the quarter with 1,245 stores compared with 1,302 stores at the end of the third quarter last year, or a decrease of 4%. Square footage was down 3% on a year-over-year basis. Share Repurchases The Company did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter of Fiscal 2026. The Company currently has $29.8 million remaining on its expanded share repurchase authorization announced in June 2023. Fiscal 2026 Outlook For Fiscal 2026, while the Company expects sales and operating income growth to last year, we are revising our outlook and lowering guidance: Now expects total sales to be up about 2% and comparable sales to be up about 3% compared to Fiscal 2025, down from prior guidance for total sales to be up 3% to 4% and comparable sales up 4% to 5% Now expects adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be around $0.95 , down from our prior expectation of $1.30 to $1.70 Guidance assumes no further share repurchases and a tax rate of 34% excluding the tax impact of OBBBA, up from prior guidance of 29% __________________________ A reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures cited in the guidance to their corresponding measures as reported pursuant to GAAP is included in Schedule B to this press release.

We have already begun implementing the initial changes to fuel growth and drive margins higher while maintaining our capital allocation framework centered around our share repurchase program.\" Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2026: Summary Operating Results Three Months Ended October 31, Percent change November 1, (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Revenues 1,866 1,976 Operating income Operating income as a percentage of revenues -120bps Adjusted operating income Adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenues -10bps Net income EBITDA EBITDA as a percentage of revenues -100bps Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues -10bps Diluted earnings per share Adjusted diluted earnings per share Net cash provided by operating activities Free cash flow 1,400 Non-GAAP measure, see Schedule 6 for information about this measure. Third Quarter Summary Results Revenues for the quarter decreased $110 million or 6% compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to ramp down in volume on existing contracts, including approximately $16 million attributable to the government shutdown, and contract completions, partially offset by new contracts. Revenues recognized from the acquisition of SilverEdge for the three months ended October 31, 2025 were immaterial. Operating income as a percentage of revenues for the quarter decreased compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to executive transition costs, net of recoveries, and the favorable resolution of the Assault Amphibious Vehicle (\"AAV\") contract termination in the prior year ($14 million), partially offset by timing and volume mix in our contract portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues for the quarter decreased to 9.9% from 10.0% for the same period in the prior year primarily due to the favorable resolution of the AAV contract termination in the prior year ($14 million), partially offset by timing and volume mix in our contract portfolio. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.69 compared to $2.13 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.58 compared to $2.61 in the prior year quarter. The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during the quarter decreased to 46.1 million from 49.8 million during the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP measure, see Schedule 6 for information about this measure. Cash Generation and Capital Deployment Cash flows provided by operating activities for the third quarter decreased $14 million compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to higher cash outflows from the usage of the Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement (\"MARPA Facility\") in the current year and other changes in working capital, partially offset by timing of customer collections. During the quarter, SAIC deployed $120 million of capital, primarily consisting of $94 million of plan share repurchases and $17 million in cash dividends. Quarterly Dividend Declared Subsequent to quarter end, on December 2, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per share of the Company's common stock payable on January 28, 2026 to stockholders of record on January 14, 2026. SAIC intends to continue paying dividends on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. Backlog and Contract Awards Net bookings for the quarter and year were approximately $2.2 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, which reflects a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 and 1.3, respectively, and a trailing twelve months book-to-bill ratio of 1.2.

Contacts Investor Relations: Joe DeNardi, joseph.w.denardi@saic.com Media: Kara Ross, kara.g.ross@saic.com GAAP to Non-GAAP Guidance Reconciliation The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted diluted EPS to GAAP diluted EPS, adjusted EBITDA margin to GAAP net income or free cash flow to GAAP net cash flows from operating activities due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation. Because certain deductions for non-GAAP exclusions used to calculate net income and cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly based on actual events, the Company is not able to forecast GAAP diluted EPS, GAAP net income or GAAP net cash flows from operating activities with reasonable certainty. The variability of the above charges may have an unpredictable and potentially significant impact on our future GAAP financial results.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "positive", "score": 0.9968847632408142}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9916183352470398}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9411933422088623}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9982258677482605}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995836615562439}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.998836100101471}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9919838309288025}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9962095022201538}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9981623291969299}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9984568357467651}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9968532919883728}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.997225284576416}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999575674533844}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9984180927276611}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.6198551058769226}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9891252517700195}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995936751365662}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.6375149488449097}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9982720613479614}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9942546486854553}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981505274772644}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9936286807060242}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9979481101036072}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995512366294861}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995824694633484}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.998140811920166}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9763373136520386}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9976444840431213}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9979621171951294}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996106028556824}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.992672860622406}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9981783628463745}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995585083961487}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9971434473991394}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9980862140655518}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.999612033367157}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9990013241767883}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9981837868690491}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994497895240784}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996302127838135}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9989897608757019}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9971787929534912}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993416666984558}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995452761650085}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.8687796592712402}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9258851408958435}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9968457818031311}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9986400008201599}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995392560958862}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994961023330688}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995908141136169}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995610117912292}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.8376118540763855}, {"label": "negative", "score": 0.9875496029853821}], "sentiment": "neutral"}], "overall_sentiment": "neutral", "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": null}, "000110465925118286": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/29534/000110465925118286/tm2532496d1_8k.htm", "filing_date": "Thu, 4 Dec 2025 06:53:11 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": true, "ticker": "DG", "items": {"item 2.02": {"text": "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data PART IV Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules PART II ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Introduction This MD&A is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition, cash flows and future prospects. This discussion and analysis compares consolidated and segment results for 2024 to 2023 and 2023 to 2022. As discussed in Item 8, Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results and related assets and liabilities of the IFP Business are reported as discontinued operations. As a result, unless specifically stated, all discussions included below reflect continuing operations for all periods presented. The reference to \"N.M.\" indicates that the calculation is not meaningful. Amounts are reported in millions, except per share amounts, unless otherwise noted. The following will be discussed and analyzed: Overview of Business and Recent Developments Business Environment and Trends Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Throughout this MD&A, we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the financial measures used to evaluate management. For additional information and reconciliations to the most closely comparable financial measures presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, see \"Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below. Overview of Business and Recent Developments We are a global company focused on delivering essential products and solutions that solve unmet consumer needs and provide Better Care for a Better World. We have manufacturing facilities in 30 countries, including our equity affiliates, and products sold in more than 175 countries and territories. Our products are sold under well-known, trusted brands such as Kleenex, Scott, Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kotex and Depend. In operating our business, we seek to: grow our portfolio of brands through consumer-centric and science-based innovation, category development and commercial execution; leverage our cost and financial discipline to fund durable growth and improve margins; and allocate capital in value-creating ways. To achieve these objectives, we will continue executing our Powering Care strategy and its three synergistic, strategic pillars: accelerate pioneering innovation, optimize our margin structure, and wire our organization for growth. Our first pillar focuses on investing in our brands to enhance our competitive advantage by leveraging our best-in-class science and proprietary, category-shaping technologies to deliver innovative product solutions that solve unmet consumer needs around the world. It also includes an emphasis on delivering breakthrough storytelling that grows category participation and brand love. Our second pillar is driven by our supply chain transformation and investment in three key areas that will enhance our value chain and improve our margin structure: value stream simplification, network optimization, and scalable automation. Our third pillar is centered on making our enterprise stronger and faster while sharpening our portfolio focus and footprint on categories and markets with the greatest long-term potential. Our strong legacy of financial discipline supports our Powering Care strategy through consistent investment in our technologies and brands, sustained supply chain productivity and enhanced working capital efficiency. Our capital allocation approach prioritizes capital investments to drive durable growth in our business, a strong and growing dividend, value accretive acquisitions that can enhance our portfolio, and allocation of excess cash flow to share repurchases. We are subject to risks and uncertainties, which can affect our business operations and financial results. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" of the 2024 Form 10-K for additional information. Changes to Reportable Segments As part of the realignment of our internal operating and management structure, during the fourth quarter of 2024, we began to manage and report our operations through three reportable segments defined by geographic regions and product groupings: North America (\"NA\"), International Personal Care (\"IPC\") and International Family Care and Professional (\"IFP\"). Further, our measure of segment profitability was changed to include the effects of changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities for subsidiaries where we have adopted highly inflationary accounting. Subsequently during 2025, our segment reporting was impacted by the IFP Transaction, discussed further below. IFP Transaction On June 5, 2025, we announced that the Company will form a joint venture with Suzano S.A. (\"Suzano\") and Suzano International Holding B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Suzano (\"Buyer\"), comprised of substantially all the operations of the Company's former IFP segment (the \"IFP Business\"). To facilitate this transaction, we entered into an Equity and Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with Buyer, pursuant to which we will, among other things, effectuate a reorganization through the transfer of certain assets, liabilities and equity interests of the IFP Business to Kimberly-Clark IFP NewCo B.V., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the \"Joint Venture\"). At the time of closing, which is expected to take place in mid-2026 and will only take place following the satisfaction of consultation requirements and customary closing conditions, including obtaining required regulatory approvals, Buyer will acquire a 51% interest in the Joint Venture for a purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion, subject to certain closing adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement, and we will retain a 49% equity interest (the \"IFP Transaction\"). As a result, the results of operations and applicable assets and liabilities of the IFP Business are reported as discontinued operations in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. See Item 8, Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The Company's continuing operations are now organized into two reportable segments defined by geographic region: North America and International Personal Care. The results of the IFP Business, including certain costs that were previously allocated to the IPC segment that relate to assets or activities that are part of the IFP Transaction, are reported as discontinued operations and excluded from segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, certain operations and commercial activities of the former IFP segment retained by the Company are now reported in the NA and IPC segments. Further, Corporate and Other was updated for all periods presented to include the following: Operations of the former IFP segment that were divested prior to the IFP Transaction and therefore not reported as discontinued operations. Costs previously allocated to the former IFP segment that are not directly attributable to the operations included in the IFP Transaction and therefore are not reported as discontinued operations. Segment results for the historical periods presented have been recast to reflect these changes. Segments are described in greater detail in Item 8, Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2024 Transformation Initiative The 2024 Transformation Initiative is designed to sharpen our strategic focus through a new operating model and strategy that leverages three synergistic pillars: Accelerating pioneering innovation to capture significant growth available in our product categories by investing in science-based and proprietary technology to solve unmet and evolving consumer needs, and delivering breakthrough storytelling to drive category participation and brand love; Optimizing our margin structure to deliver superior consumer propositions at every rung of the good, better, best ladder, and implement initiatives and deploy technology and data analytics designed to create a fast, adaptable, integrated supply chain with greater visibility that can deliver continuous improvement; and Wiring our organization for growth to drive agility, speed, and focused execution that extends our competitive advantages further into the future. Our new operating model and Powering Care strategy is intended to drive durable, long-term growth. Specifically, we are harnessing our inherent strengths, powerhouse brands and categories, science as our competitive advantage, and scalable capabilities led by top talent to sharpen our focus on growth. As we execute our strategy, we will reduce our structural cost base by realigning our internal operating and management structure to streamline our global supply chain and improve the efficiency of our corporate and regional overhead cost structures. The transformation is expected to impact our organization in all major geographies, and workforce reductions are expected to be in the range of 4% to 5% Certain actions under the 2024 Transformation Initiative are being finalized for implementation, and accounting for such actions will commence when the actions are authorized for execution. The 2024 Transformation Initiative is expected to be completed by the end of 2026. Total pre-tax savings are expected to be $3.0 billion in gross productivity; inclusive of input cost and manufacturing cost savings, and $200 in selling, general and administrative expenses. Total costs are anticipated to be approximately $1.5 billion pre-tax. Cash costs are expected to be approximately half of that amount, primarily related to workforce reductions and other program costs. Expected non-cash charges are primarily related to incremental depreciation and asset write-offs, including losses associated with the expected exit of certain markets. For the year ended December 31, 2024, total 2024 Transformation Initiative charges were $457 pre-tax ($339 after-tax). Acquisition and Divestiture Activity On July 1, 2024, we completed the sale transaction that was announced on April 7, 2024, of our personal protective equipment (\"PPE\") business for total consideration of $635, including the initial purchase price of $640 less working capital and other closing adjustments of $5. The transaction included Kimtech branded products, such as gloves, apparel and masks, and KleenGuard branded products, such as gloves, apparel, respirators and eyewear, which serve a variety of scientific and industrial industries globally. Upon closure of the transaction, a pre-tax gain of $566 ($453 after-tax) was recognized in Other (income) and expense, net. This gain is net of transaction costs of $14 that were determined to be directly attributable to the sale transaction. On February 24, 2022, we completed our acquisition of a majority and controlling share of Thinx Inc. (\"Thinx\"), an industry leader in the reusable period and incontinence underwear category, for total consideration of $181. Subsequently in 2023, we acquired the remaining outstanding ownership interests in Thinx for additional purchase consideration of $95. As the purchase of additional ownership in an already controlled subsidiary represents an equity transaction, no gain or loss was recognized in consolidated net income or comprehensive income. See Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. On June 1, 2023, we completed the sale transaction of our Neve tissue brand and related consumer and professional tissue assets in Brazil for $212. Upon closure of the transaction, a gain of $74 pre-tax was recognized in Other (income) and expense, net. We incurred divestiture-related costs of $30 pre-tax which were recorded in Cost of products sold and Marketing, research and general expenses, resulting in a net benefit of $44 pre-tax ($26 after-tax). See Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Business Environment and Trends Our results of operations have been, and we expect them to continue to be, affected by the following factors and key trends, which may cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical results discussed under \"Results of Operations.\" Birth Rate Trends - Sales of our baby and child care products are highly correlated with birth rate trends. In recent years, birth rate declines in key countries, including China, South Korea and the U.S., have pressured category volume growth rates. To help mitigate the effects of birth rate declines, we aim to drive sales growth at or ahead of category growth rates through innovation, premiumization, strong brand building plans and digital marketing investment as part of our growth strategy. Competition - Our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace. Our competitors include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers which offer products that are typically sold at lower prices. In particular, private label market share has been increasing in the tissue category. Increased purchases of private label products could reduce net sales of our higher-margin products which would negatively impact our profitability. While the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and e-tailers. This market environment has resulted in increased pressure on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue in the coming year. Pricing - Our net sales growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address market conditions. We adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment, technological improvements, product innovations and changes in our raw material, distribution, energy and other input costs. Price changes may affect net sales, earnings and market share in the near term as the market adjusts to new pricing and other market conditions. Operating Costs - Our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, general business taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. We manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, and pricing actions. To remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability, including our 2024 Transformation Initiative. While we saw stabilization in input costs in 2024 with tailwinds in fiber, resin and energy, the overall cost basket remains elevated versus pre-pandemic levels. In 2025, we expect net input costs to be inflationary, including the impact from currency on our non-U.S. operations. Evolving Consumer Product and Shopping Preferences - The retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve due to the rapid growth of e-commerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. Changing consumer preferences also include increased concerns in regard to post-consumer waste and packaging materials and their impact on environmental sustainability. If we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease. We believe our Powering Care strategy, sharpened growth focus, sustainability initiatives, innovation pipeline and continued investment in e-commerce capabilities - underpinned by our commitment to delivering Better Care for a Better World - make us well positioned relative to these changing external dynamics. Volatility of Global Markets - Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our international operations, including in emerging markets. Some of these markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions. Volatility in these markets affects our production costs and the demand for our products and may impact our supply chain and distribution networks. Volatility in global consumer demand, commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates increased significantly over the past few years and is expected to continue in the near term. Climate Change - We operate in many regions around the world where our businesses could be disrupted by climate change. Our climate change risk categories include risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy (\"Transition Risks\") and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change (\"Physical Risks\"). Transition Risks include increased costs of carbon emission, increased cost to produce products in compliance with future regulations, increased raw materials cost, shifts in customer/consumer values and other legal, regulatory and technological risks. Physical Risks include the risk of direct damage to assets or supply chain disruption caused by severe weather events such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts. We continue to progress toward our 2030 Sustainability Goals which include elements that aim for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, use of natural forest fibers, use of plastics and use of water in water-stressed regions. War in Ukraine - Consistent with the humanitarian nature of our products, we manufacture and sell only essential items in Russia, such as baby diapers and feminine pads, which are critical to the health and hygiene of women, girls and babies. Beginning in March 2022, we significantly adjusted our business in Russia, substantially curtailing media, advertising and promotional activity and suspending capital investments, other than certain maintenance investments, in our sole manufacturing facility in Russia. Our Russia business has represented approximately 1% to 2% of our net global sales, operating profit and total assets. Our ability to continue our operations in Russia may change as the situation evolves. We have experienced high input costs, supply chain complexities, reduced consumer demand, restricted access to raw materials and production assets, and restricted access to financial institutions, as well as supply chain, professional services, monetary, currency, trade and payment/investment sanctions and related controls. As the business, geopolitical and regulatory environment concerning Russia evolves, we may not be able to sustain the limited manufacture and sale of our products, and our assets may be partially or fully impaired. Results of Operations Consolidated Results The following discussion and analysis compares our consolidated results of operations and other information for 2024 to 2023 and 2023 to 2022. Prior periods have been recast to reflect the reporting of the IFP Business as discontinued operations as discussed above. Summary of Results Year Ended December 31 Change 2024 vs. 2023 Change 2023 vs. 2022 Net Sales 16,805 17,146 16,952 (2.0) Gross Profit 6,289 6,269 5,524 Operating Profit 2,700 1,928 2,309 (16.5) Provision for income taxes (442) (343) (405) (15.3) Income from Continuing Operations 2,192 1,459 1,679 (13.1) Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes Net Income Attributable to Kimberly-Clark Corporation 2,545 1,764 1,934 (8.8) Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations (11.9) Diluted Earnings per Share from Discontinued Operations Adjusted Results - Continuing Operations Year Ended December 31 Change 2024 vs. 2023 Change 2023 vs. 2022 Adjusted Gross Profit 6,433 6,284 5,524 Adjusted Operating Profit 2,727 2,542 2,245 Adjusted Earnings per Share Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (a) Adjusted amounts are Non-GAAP financial measures.

(b) Represents the change in net sales excluding the impacts of currency translation and divestitures and business exits. Organic Sales Growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. (c) Impact of the sale of the Brazil tissue and professional business, sale of the PPE business and other exited businesses and markets in conjunction with the 2024 Transformation Initiative. Net sales of $16.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 declined 2.0% primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and divestitures and business exits, partially offset by organic sales growth. Organic sales increased 3.9% driven by a 2.7% increase in price, primarily in hyperinflationary economies, coupled with gains in volume and mix. Gross and Operating Profits Gross profit of $6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 was flat to the prior year, while gross margin of 37.4% increased approximately 80 basis points. Gross margin in 2024 included approximately 90 basis points for charges related to the 2024 Transformation Initiative. Excluding these charges, adjusted gross margin increased approximately 170 basis points to 38.3% primarily due to gross productivity savings from integrated margin management of approximately $410, favorable pricing net of inflation and volume gains, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Operating profit of $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 40.0%. Results in 2024 included a $565 gain from the sale of our PPE business, offset by charges of $456 related to the 2024 Transformation Initiative and $136 from the impairment of intangible assets and litigation and regulatory matters associated with a previously exited business. Results in 2023 included $658 of charges from the impairment of intangible assets and a $44 net benefit related to the sale of our Brazil tissue and professional business. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit was $2.7 billion in 2024 and $2.5 billion in 2023. Drivers of the changes in adjusted operating profit were: Percent Change in Adjusted Operating Profit Volume Net Price Input Costs Other Manufacturing Costs Currency Translation Other Total 2024 versus 2023 (8.3) (7.0) (2.8) (a) Includes net impact of productivity initiatives, product and supply chain investments and other changes in cost of products sold. (b) Includes impact of changes in product mix, marketing, research and general expenses and other (income) and expense, net. (c) Adjusted Operating Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. Adjusted operating results benefited from higher adjusted gross profit discussed above, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts, primarily due to hyperinflationary economies, and higher marketing, research and general expenses. Income from Continuing Operations Income from Continuing Operations of $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 50.2% primarily due to the increase in operating profit discussed above. Net interest expense of $222 was largely in line with the prior year period. Our share of net income of equity companies was $216, an increase of 10.2% primarily driven by Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V., which benefited from volume, mix and pricing growth and productivity savings, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and higher marketing, research and general expenses. The effective tax rate was 18.3% in 2024 compared to 21.4% in 2023, with the decline primarily due to the net benefit of items not reflective of our underlying operations discussed in the section above. Excluding these benefits, the adjusted effective tax rate was 22.7% in 2024 compared to 22.6% in 2023. Diluted earnings per share of $6.41 for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 48.7% reflective of the growth in income discussed above. Adjusted earnings per share of $6.16 increased 8.6% primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes of $386 for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 26.6% primarily due to gross productivity savings, partially offset by unfavorable pricing net of inflation and higher research, selling and general expenses. 2023 versus 2022 Net Sales: Drivers of the changes in net sales were: Percent Change in Net Sales Volume Mix/Other Net Price Divestitures and Business Exits Currency Translation Total Organic 2023 versus 2022 (1.3) (0.7) (3.0) (a) Total may not sum across due to rounding. (b) Represents the change in net sales excluding the impacts of currency translation and divestitures and business exits. Organic Sales Growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. (c) Impact of the sale of the Brazil tissue and professional business. Net sales of $17.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 1.1% primarily due to organic sales growth, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and divestitures and business exits. Organic sales increased 4.8% primarily from a 5.5% increase in net pricing, partially offset by lower volumes. Gross and Operating Profits Gross profit of $6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 13.5%, while gross margin of 36.6% increased 400 basis points primarily due to favorable pricing net of inflation and gross productivity savings from integrated margin management of approximately $440, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Operating profit of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased 16.5%. Results in 2023 included $658 of charges from the impairment of intangible assets and a $44 net benefit related to the sale of our Brazil tissue and professional business. Results in 2022 included a $64 net benefit related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Thinx. Excluding these items, adjusted operating profit was $2.5 billion in 2023 and $2.2 billion in 2022. Drivers of the changes in adjusted operating profit were: Percent Change in Adjusted Operating Profit Volume Net Price Input Costs Other Manufacturing Costs Currency Translation Other Total 2023 versus 2022 (3.3) (5.5) (5.3) (19.7) (a) Includes net impact of productivity initiatives, product and supply chain investments and other changes in cost of products sold. (b) Includes impact of changes in product mix, marketing, research and general expenses and other (income) and expense, net. (c) Adjusted Operating Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. Adjusted operating results benefited from higher gross profit discussed above, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts, primarily due to hyperinflationary economies, and higher marketing, research and general expenses. Income from Continuing Operations Income from Continuing Operations of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased 13.1% primarily due to the decrease in operating profit discussed above. Our share of net income of equity companies was $196, an increase of 69.0% primarily driven by Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V., which benefited from favorable currency impacts, pricing growth and gross productivity savings, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and marketing, research and general expenses. The effective tax rate was 21.4% in 2023 compared to 20.6% in 2022, while the adjusted effective tax rates for the same periods were 22.6% and 21.6%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share of $4.31 for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased 11.9% reflective of the decline in Income from Continuing Operations discussed above. Adjusted earnings per share of $5.67 increased 17.9% primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and improved net income from our equity companies. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes of $305 for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 8.2% primarily due to favorable pricing net of inflation, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and lower volumes. Segment Results The following presents the results of the Company's reportable segments and compares our segment net sales, operating profit and other information for 2024 to 2023 and 2023 to 2022.

North America Year Ended December 31 % change % change 2024 vs. 2023 2023 vs. 2022 Net Sales 11,017 10,996 10,476 Operating Profit 2,542 2,514 2,116 2024 versus 2023 Net sales of $11.0 billion were flat as an increase in organic sales of 1.1% was largely offset by divestitures and business exits. Organic sales benefited from volume and mix gains, led by Baby & Child Care and Adult Care. Operating profit of $2.5 billion increased 1.1% primarily due to gross productivity savings and volume growth, partially offset by incremental manufacturing costs and higher advertising and promotion expenses. 2023 versus 2022 Net sales of $11.0 billion increased 5.0% primarily due to higher net selling prices across the entire product portfolio, led by Professional and Family Care. Operating profit of $2.5 billion increased 18.8% primarily due to favorable pricing net of inflation and gross productivity savings, partially offset by higher marketing, research and general expenses. International Personal Care Year Ended December 31 % change % change 2024 vs. 2023 2023 vs. 2022 Net Sales 5,743 5,940 6,109 (3.3) (2.8) Operating Profit (4.9) 2024 versus 2023 Net sales of $5.7 billion decreased 3.3% as unfavorable currency impacts of 12.1% were partially offset by a 9.0% increase in organic sales. Organic sales benefited from higher net selling prices of 7.7%, primarily from hyperinflationary economies, and volume growth of 0.9%, led by China. Operating profit of $826 increased 22.7% primarily due to favorable pricing net of inflation and gross productivity savings, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and higher manufacturing costs. Pricing and unfavorable currency impacts were primarily driven by hyperinflationary economies. Other operating costs, namely incremental advertising investments, were largely offset by lower monetary losses from changes in exchange rates in highly inflationary economies. 2023 versus 2022 Net Sales of $5.9 billion decreased 2.8% as unfavorable currency impacts of 7.8% were partially offset by a 5.0% increase in organic sales. Organic sales benefited from higher net selling prices of 7.8%, primarily from hyperinflationary economies, and product mix gains of 1.3%, partially offset by lower volumes. Operating profit of $673 decreased 4.9% primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts, higher marketing, research and general expenses and lower volumes, partially offset by favorable pricing net of inflation. Pricing and unfavorable currency impacts were primarily driven by hyperinflationary economies. Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) As discussed in Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the results of the IFP Business are reported as discontinued operations. The following tables provide unaudited summarized financial information based on our Consolidated Financial Statements after giving effect to the reporting of the IFP Business as discontinued operations for each quarter of fiscal year 2024 and 2023. (In millions, except per share amounts) First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Net Sales 4,326 4,231 4,144 4,104 Gross Profit 1,686 1,594 1,564 1,445 Income from Continuing Operations Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes Net Income Attributable to Kimberly-Clark Corporation Earnings Per Share - Basic: Continuing operations Discontinued operations Basic Earnings per Share Earnings Per Share - Diluted: Continuing operations Discontinued operations Diluted Earnings per Share (In millions, except per share amounts) First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Net Sales 4,338 4,325 4,321 4,162 Gross Profit 1,518 1,570 1,640 1,541 Income from Continuing Operations Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes Net Income Attributable to Kimberly-Clark Corporation Earnings Per Share - Basic: Continuing operations Discontinued operations Basic Earnings per Share Earnings Per Share - Diluted: Continuing operations Discontinued operations Diluted Earnings per Share Liquidity and Capital Resources As detailed in Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented on a consolidated basis for both continuing operations and discontinued operations. As a result, unless specifically stated, the following discussion reflects Kimberly-Clark's consolidated results for all periods presented. Cash Provided by Operations Cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $3.2 billion compared to $3.5 billion in the prior year. Cash flow from operations benefited from higher operating profit, excluding the effect of non-cash charges, however this increase was more than offset by changes in working capital relative to the prior year coupled with cash payments for the 2024 Transformation Initiative. The impact to cash from working capital was primarily driven by the timing of cash flows associated with the lapping of higher commodity and energy costs in prior periods. Obligations The following table presents our total contractual obligations on a consolidated basis for which cash flows are fixed or determinable. Total 2030+ Long-term debt 7,451 4,465 Interest payments on long-term debt 2,814 1,632 Operating lease liabilities Unconditional purchase obligations 2,188 1,507 Open purchase orders 2,338 1,885 Total contractual obligations 15,271 4,376 1,631 1,188 6,167 The unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily superabsorbent materials, pulp and utilities. Although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material. The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts for goods and services we have negotiated for delivery. The table does not include amounts where payments are discretionary or the timing is uncertain. The following payments are not included in the table: We will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute approximately $15 to these plans in 2025. Other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. Based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of approximately $50 through 2034. Accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests. Investing ash used for investing for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $100 compared to $418 in the prior year as capital spending in the current year was largely offset by proceeds from asset and business dispositions. Capital spending was $721 for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $766 in the prior year. Proceeds from asset and business dispositions of $651 primarily reflected the sale of our PPE business while prior year proceeds of $245 primarily reflected the sale of our Brazil tissue and professional business. We expect capital spending to be approximately $1.0 to $1.2 billion in 2025, including incremental spending from the 2024 Transformation Initiative. Financing Cash used for financing for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $3.2 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased share repurchases, debt repayments and dividends paid. During 2024, we repurchased 7.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $1.0 billion through a broker in the open market, and paid $1.6 billion in dividends. We issue long-term debt in the public market periodically. Proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details. Our short-term debt, which consists of U.S. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-U.S. subsidiaries, was $3 as of December 31, 2024 (included in debt payable within one year on the Consolidated Balance Sheets). The average month-end balance of short-term debt for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $5. These short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding to support our operations. The level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions, dividends and income taxes. We maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in June 2028 a $750 revolving credit facility which expires in May 2025. These facilities, currently unused, support our commercial paper program, and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason. As of December 31, 2024, total debt from continuing operations was $7.4 billion compared to $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2023. In October 2021, members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project (\"Inclusive Framework\") agreed to a two-pillar solution to reform the international tax framework to realign international taxation with economic activities and value creation. Inclusive Framework members agreed to a coordinated system of Global anti-Base Erosion rules, referred to as Pillar 2, that are designed to ensure large multinational enterprises pay a minimum 15% level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction in which they operate. Many countries have formally implemented Pillar 2, and several other countries have draft legislation to implement this framework. The implementation of Pillar 2 has not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We will continue to monitor and evaluate new legislation and guidance, which could change our current assessment. We believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, obligations related to our 2024 Transformation Initiative, capital spending, pension contributions, share repurchases, dividends and other needs for the foreseeable future. Further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. The critical accounting estimates we used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. The critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, pension and other postretirement benefits, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments, and goodwill and other intangible assets. These critical accounting estimates have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Sales Incentives and Trade Promotion Allowances Trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. Rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales. Promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs. Generally, the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories, and the cost is recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized. Our related accounting policies are discussed in Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Employee Postretirement Benefits Substantially all regular employees in the U.S. and the United Kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain U.S. and United Kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit (the \"Principal Plans\"). Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. Our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in Item 8, Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the obligations: Long-term rate of return on plan assets . The expected long-term rate of return is evaluated on an annual basis. In setting these assumptions, we consider a number of factors including projected future returns by asset class relative to the target asset allocation. Actual asset allocations are regularly reviewed and they are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocations when considered appropriate. As of December 31, 2024, the Principal Plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $1.0 billion. These unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, and whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the \"corridor\" as required If the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the Principal Plans were lowered by 0.25%, the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2025. Discount rate . The discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future U.S. pension obligation as of December 31, 2024 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan. For the United Kingdom plan, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities. Each year's expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations. If the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25%, the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2025, and the December 31, 2024 pension liability would increase by about $50. Other assumptions . There are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations, primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections. Pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $50 in 2025. Pension expense beyond 2025 will depend on future investment p erformance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans. Substantially all U.S. retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. Changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rate used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate: Discount rate . The determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension ben efit section above, and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that country's pension obligation. If the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25%, the impact to 2025 other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the December 31, 2024 benefit liability would not be material. Health care cost trend rate . The health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including our recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace. Deferred Income Taxes and Potential Assessments As a global organization, we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally. Changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results, particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the U.S. and uncertain tax positions. Our income tax related accounting policies, account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances . We have recorded deferred tax assets related to, among other matters, income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets. These carryforwards are primarily in non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the U.S. Foreign tax credits earned in the U.S. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. In determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Undistributed earnings s of December 31, 2024, we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $10.6 billion. Earnings of $3.4 billion were previously subject to U.S. federal income tax. Any additional taxes due with respect to such previously-taxed foreign earnings, if repatriated, would generally be limited to foreign and U.S. state income taxes. Deferred taxes have been recorded on $932 of earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated. We do not intend to distribute any remaining foreign earnings and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for foreign and U.S. income taxes on such earnings. We consider any excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. The determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis or the remaining foreign earnings is not practicable. Uncertain tax positions . We record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate. Where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns. Where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. These liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 20 years. We typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to measure the acquisition date fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired. Events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares, increased competition or loss of market share, obsolescence, product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life, deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results. Goodwill In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is more than its carrying value. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environments, historical and projected financial performance, significant changes in the reporting unit and the magnitude of excess fair value over carrying amount from the previous quantitative impairment testing. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test to estimate fair value must be performed. When a quantitative test is considered necessary, estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model and a market-based approach. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and earnings. The other key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow model include, but are not limited to, discount rates, actual business trends experienced, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, inflation and terminal growth rates. We completed our required annual assessment of goodwill for impairment for all our reporting units using a qualitative assessment as of the first day of the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2024, concluding that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the respective carrying amounts. During the fourth quarter of 2024, our internal reporting and management structure changed, resulting in changes in the composition of our reportable segments and reporting units. As a result of these changes, we reassigned assets and liabilities to the applicable reporting units and allocated goodwill using a relative fair value approach. As this change in the composition of our reporting units was considered a goodwill triggering event, we performed an impairment test on both a pre- and post- reorganization basis. In both cases, we concluded there was no goodwill impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the respective carrying amounts. Other Intangible Assets We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, primarily brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model and a market-based approach using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. The cash flows used in the discounted cash flow model are consistent with those we use in our internal planning, which gives consideration to actual business trends experienced and the long-term business strategy.

Announces Third Quarter 2025 Results Successfully Listed as a Public Company on NYSE Formed Strategic Partnership with GE Aerospace Including $300M Equity Investment Received FAA Part 35 Type Certification for Hartzell Propeller BUSINESSWIRE South Burlington, VT December 4, 2025 BETA Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BETA) (\"BETA\" or the \"Company\"), an electric aerospace company, leading in the development and commercialization of electric aircraft, charging infrastructure, and aerospace grade electric propulsion, today announced its financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2025. Kyle Clark, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"It's been an incredibly exciting time at BETA following our recent listing on the New York Stock Exchange last month. As a newly public company, we remain firmly grounded in what makes BETA uniqueour simple, stepwise approach, our vertical integration and our focus on designing and manufacturing the complete electric aviation ecosystem to meet the needs of customers around the world. We are redefining aerospace and capturing the significant, untapped opportunity in sustainable, reliable, and efficient electric aviation.\" Third Quarter Highlights Initial Customer Deliveries: Delivered an ALIA CTOL (as defined below) aircraft to Norway for demonstration flights with the Bristow Group in Norway's international test arena for zero and low emission aviation. Additionally, BETA shipped another ALIA CTOL to New Zealand for demonstration flights with Air New Zealand. First Certified AAM Technology: Certified the first pusher propeller in partnership with Hartzell under FAA Part 35 Type Certification for electric aircraft. This milestone supports the process of obtaining Type Certification for BETA's H500A electric engine under Part 33 given the shared requirements among each program. Progressed VTOL Testing: Completed and was granted a Special Airworthiness Certificate by the FAA for its first production ALIA VTOL (as defined below) and successfully entered piloted flight testing. Partnered with Legacy Aerospace on Hybrid Solutions: Formed a strategic partnership with GE Aerospace, including a $300 million equity investment, to co-develop a hybrid electric turbogenerator for Advanced Air Mobility applications, including long-range hybrid Vertical Takeoff and Landing (\"VTOL\") aircraft, future BETA aircraft, and additional applications. Varied Propulsion Applications: BETA and General Dynamics announced a partnership in which BETA will design and manufacture propulsion systems for classified undersea applications. This partnership is a testament to BETA's full stack technology control and leadership within electric aerospace. Growing Orderbook: As of September 30, 2025, BETA had an existing civil aircraft backlog of 891 aircraft worth $3.5 billion, of which 289 are for firm orders and 602 are for options. The strength of this orderbook highlights the diversity of civil uses for our aircraft, including cargo, logistics, medical, and passenger missions. Third Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights For the Three Months Ended September 30, (In thousands, except per share amounts) Revenues 8,918 3,066 Cost of Revenues 2,741 1,189 Gross Margin 6,177 1,877 General and Administrative 30,380 20,834 Research and Development 56,371 54,043 Total Operating Expenses 86,751 74,877 Loss from Operations (80,574) (73,000) Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders (451,810) (82,099) Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders (9.83) (1.81) Adjusted EBITDA (67,575) (64,194) Capital Expenditures 12,957 13,052 Cash and Cash Equivalents 687,627 52,248 In addition to results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), this press release contains financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to their related GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental tables later in this press release. Represents purchases of property and equipment. Financial Highlights Revenues during the quarter ended September 30, 2025 were $8.9 million. Product revenue was $2.9 million, exceeding management's expectations as the result of ahead-of-schedule motor deliveries that were originally planned for the fourth quarter. Service revenue was $6 million driven by defense contracts. Together, product and service revenue growth highlight BETA's leadership position in both the technological innovation and execution of electric aviation. Operating expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 2025 were $86.8 million, including $56.4 million of research and development expense and $30.4 million of general and administrative expense. Net loss attributable to common stockholders during the quarter was $451.8 million, or $9.83 per share, unfavorably impacted by the loss on issuance of convertible preferred stock. Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter ended September 30, 2025 was ($67.6) million, reflecting our efforts to closely manage expenses. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $13.0 million, further supporting the expansion of our manufacturing capacity, testing facilities, and other resources for aircraft development. Cash Flow and Liquidity BETA ended the quarter with $687.6 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $52.2 million in the prior year period. This amount excludes approximately $1.1 billion in IPO net proceeds that will be reported in our results for the annual period ended December 31, 2025. The Company continues to invest in research and development, manufacturing scale-up, and working capital to support growth and personnel expansion. Ongoing investment in production facilities, vertiports, and supporting infrastructure remains critical as BETA advances toward commercialization. Financial Outlook BETA currently expects full year 2025 Revenue to be in the range of $29 million to $33 million and full year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of ($295) million to ($325) million. We have not reconciled our forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA estimates because certain items that impact this non-GAAP metric are uncertain or out of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted. In particular, stock based compensation expense is impacted by the future fair market value of our common stock along with other factors, all of which are difficult to predict, subject to frequent change, or not within our control. The actual amount of these expenses during 2025 will have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. Accordingly, a reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP metric is not available without unreasonable effort. Webcast and Conference Call Details BETA will host a live webcast and conference call at 8:30 am ET today to discuss the quarter's results. A link to the live webcast and supporting materials can be accessed on the Company's Investor Relations website and a replay webcast will be available following the call. Participants may also join the conference call by dialing 800-343-4136 (domestic) or 203-518-9843 (international) and entering the access code BETAQ325.

(NASDAQ: AXGN), a global leader in developing and marketing innovative surgical technologies for the restoration of peripheral nerve function, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has approved the Biologics License Application (\"BLA\") for AVANCE (acellular nerve allograft-arwx). Avance is an acellular nerve scaffold for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 1 month or older with sensory, mixed, and motor peripheral nerve discontinuities. The indications for sensory nerve discontinuities >25mm and for mixed and motor nerve discontinuities were approved under FDA's Accelerated Approval pathway based on the effect on static two-point discrimination in sensory nerve gaps 25mm, which provided empirical evidence to reasonably predict clinical benefit given similarities in pathophysiology and anticipated therapeutic effects. Continued approval for these indications depends on verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies. \"All stakeholders in Axogen's mission to restore health and improve quality of life by making restoration of peripheral nerve function an expected standard of care should take great pride in today's approval,\" said Michael Dale, Axogen's Chief Executive Officer. \"This approval represents a meaningful shift from our historical classification as a human tissue product and brings the product in line with FDA's classification of Avance as a biologic. This milestone clarifies and strengthens our regulatory footing and confirms approval for use of Avance as an acceptable therapeutic option for treating peripheral nerve discontinuities in all of Axogen's present nerve repair use cases. The approved BLA and successful transition of Avance to a biologic regulatory framework should give all stakeholders the assurance that Avance has been rigorously evaluated and determined to be safe, pure, and potent for its intended use, and that its benefits outweigh its known or potential risks. We want to thank FDA and the surgical community for the tremendous work and collaboration over more than a decade to make this therapy available to patients.\" Commercial availability of the licensed Avance product is expected early in the second quarter of 2026. In the meantime, Avance remains available under the current tissue framework. About Avance Indications AVANCE is an acellular nerve scaffold indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged one month and older with: Sensory nerve discontinuity (25mm) Sensory nerve discontinuity (>25mm); Approved under accelerated approval based on static two-point discrimination (s2PD) at 12 months in sensory nerve gaps 25 mm, which reasonably predicts clinical benefit. Continued approval is contingent upon confirmatory clinical trial results. Mixed and motor nerve discontinuity; Approved under accelerated approval based on s2PD outcomes in sensory nerves; continued approval is contingent upon confirmatory clinical trial results. Important Safety Information Warnings and Precautions Procedural Complications: Monitor for procedural complications, including pain, hyperesthesia, infection, implant site swelling, adhesions, hypertrophic scar formation, impaired motor or sensory function, bleeding, and neuroma formation, and manage accordingly.

Back Forty Project Michigan - Development Update The Company has made a strategic decision to resume work on the Back Forty Project in Michigan. The Company is in discussions with consulting firms to complete a feasibility study and is planning on beginning the permitting process. A technical report summary for the Back Forty Project was filed in October 2023 and included a cash flow model based on $1,800 gold and $1.25 Zinc. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a 50% increase in the price of gold to $2,700 increased the net present value of the project by over 100% to approximately $430 million. While the economics were attractive when the study was completed, the project is much more robust at current consensus metal prices assumptions. About GRC: Gold Resource Corporation is a gold and silver producer, developer, and explorer with its operations centered on the Don David Gold Mine in Oaxaca, Mexico. Under the direction of an experienced board and senior leadership team, the Company's focus is to unlock the significant upside potential of its existing infrastructure and large land position surrounding the mine in Oaxaca, Mexico and to develop the Back Forty Project in Michigan, USA.

Combined with ongoing expense management, we converted sales growth of 4% into 13% adjusted EPS growth.\" \"Given our robust first quarter performance, we are raising our full-year adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS guidance. We remain on track to deliver a record fiscal 2026, with the midpoint of our expectations including sales of $3.8 billion, incremental margin of more than 40%, and high-single digit adjusted earnings growth.\" All EPS figures refer to diluted EPS.

Donaldson Company Reports Fiscal First Quarter 2026 Earnings - Page 2 of 5 First Quarter Operating Results Sales o f $935.4 million increased 3.9% compared with 2025 driven by pricing benefits, favorable foreign currency translation and volume growth. Three Months Ended October 31, 2025 Reported % Change Constant Currency % Change Mobile Solutions segment Off-Road On-Road (27.1) (27.7) Aftermarket Total Mobile Solutions segment Industrial Solutions segment Industrial Filtration Solutions Aerospace and Defense (7.1) (8.4) Total Industrial Solutions segment (1.1) Life Sciences segment Total Life Sciences segment Total Company Mobile Solutions segment (Mobile) sales increased 4.5% as a result of pricing, volume growth and currency translation. Aftermarket sales rose 6.5% from continued share gains in the independent channel and solid OE channel demand. Off-Road sales increased 6.1% as supportive construction market conditions more than offset continued headwinds in agriculture. On-Road sales decreased 27.1% due to lower global truck production. Industrial Solutions segment (Industrial) sales were approximately flat compared with prior year with positive pricing and currency translation offsetting volume declines, particularly in the Defense business. Industrial Filtration Solutions (IFS) sales rose 1.6% driven by strength in new Power Generation systems and dust collection replacement part sales, partially offset by a decrease in Industrial Hydraulics. Aerospace and Defense sales declined 7.1%, due to soft Defense sales. Life Sciences segment (Life Sciences) sales increased 13.1% as a result of strong new equipment sales in Food and Beverage and Disk Drive. Donaldson Company Reports Fiscal First Quarter 2026 Earnings - Page 3 of 5 Gross margin was 35.2%, down versus 35.5% in 2025 due to increased operating costs, partially offset by pricing benefits. Adjusted gross margin was 35.4% compared with 35.6% in the prior year. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.2%, favorable by 180 basis points versus 21.0% in 2025, driven by leverage on higher sales, cost optimization initiatives and expense discipline. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.9%, compared with 20.7% a year ago. Operating income as a percentage of sales (operating margin) was 16.0% compared with 14.5% in 2025 as a result of operating expense leverage. Adjusted operating margin was 15.5%, a 60-basis point year-over-year improvement. Interest expense was $7.1 million versus $5.5 million a year ago, primarily due to higher debt levels. Other income, net was $5.3 million compared with $5.2 million in 2025. The Company's effective tax rate was 22.8%, favorable compared with 24.2% a year ago as a result of an increase in discrete tax benefits. During the first quarter, Donaldson paid $34.7 million in dividends and repurchased 1.0% of its shares outstanding for $91.9 million. Updated Fiscal 2026 Outlook Adjusted full-year EPS is expected to be within a range of $3.95 and $4.11, an increase from the previous range of $3.92 and $4.08 and excluding a $0.03 per share net gain recognized in the first quarter 2026. Fiscal 2025 GAAP and adjusted EPS were $3.05 and $3.68, respectively. Sales are forecast to grow 1% to 5% year over year, consistent with prior expectations and inclusive of a pricing benefit of approximately one percentage points. Currency translation and tariff impacts are projected to be immaterial. Mobile sales are projected to be flat to up 4% versus prior year, in line with previous guidance. Off-Road sales are forecast to increase mid-single digits as certain market conditions begin to improve following declines in the prior year. On-Road sales are now expected to be flat due to muted global truck production. Aftermarket sales are forecast to grow low-single digits, driven by continued market share gains and increasing vehicle utilization rates. Industrial sales continue to be forecast to increase between 2% and 6% compared with 2025. IFS sales are projected to grow mid-single digits with growth across all businesses, including dust collection and Power Generation. Aerospace and Defense sales are expected to be flat compared with prior year after cycling against all-time-high levels in the prior year. Life Sciences sales are expected to grow between 1% and 5% versus 2025, consistent with prior guidance and driven by ongoing strength in Food & Beverage and Disk Drive. Donaldson Company Reports Fiscal First Quarter 2026 Earnings - Page 4 of 5 Adjusted 2026 operating margin is expected to be between 16.2% and 16.8%, up from previous guidance of between 16.1% and 16.7%. Fiscal 2025 operating margin was 13.4%, or 15.7% on an adjusted basis. The year-over-year improvement in operating margin is driven by gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $24 million and other income is forecast to be between $14 million and $18 million. Donaldson projects a fiscal 2026 adjusted effective income tax rate of between 23.5% and 25.5%. Capital expenditures are forecast to be between $65 million and $85 million and adjusted free cash flow conversion is expected to be in a range of 85% and 95%. For the full year, Donaldson anticipates repurchasing between 2.0% and 3.0% of its shares outstanding.

Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer; Marc D. Graff, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dino DiPerna, Senior Vice President, Global Research & Development; Jason M. Phipps, Senior Vice President, Global Customer Engagement; and David M. Rothenstein, Senior Vice President, Chief Strategy Officer and Secretary.

On November 27, 2025, Prime World International Holdings, Ltd. (\"Prime World\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., entered into a credit facility with Taishin International Bank in Taiwan (the \"Bank\"), consisting of a NT$100,000,000 line of credit (the \"NT$100M Credit Line\") and a US$2,000,000 line of credit (the \"US$2M Credit Line\", collectively, with the NT$100M Credit Line, the \"Credit Facility\"). Prime World may utilize the Credit Facility from November 27, 2025 through October 31, 2026. Borrowings under the NT$100M Credit Line may be drawn as short-term loans, each with a three-month draw term. The current interest rate is approximately 2.5%, but the rate for each draw remains subject to separate negotiation, and the facility may be used on a revolving basis. Interest on outstanding borrowings will be payable monthly, and all principal amounts will be due at the end of the applicable draw term. In contrast, the US$2M Credit Line is a derivatives-based facility rather than a loan facility and may be used by Prime World to enter into foreign exchange hedging transactions, including the Bank's foreign-exchange-linked products. Pricing for each hedging transaction will be determined based on the Bank's prevailing foreign exchange rates or quoted terms at the time the transaction is executed. Prime World's obligations under the Credit Facility will be secured by a promissory note executed between Prime World and the Bank. The agreements for the Credit Facility contain representations and warranties, and events of default applicable to Prime World that are customary for agreements of this type.

As noted in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 11, 2024, Grant Thornton was engaged as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm on April 5, 2024. Grant Thornton has not issued an audit report on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for any year or any period. During the period from April 5, 2024 through November 26, 2025, there have been no (1) disagreements within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K between the Company and Grant Thornton on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, any of which, if not resolved to Grant Thornton's satisfaction, would have caused Grant Thornton to make reference thereto in their reports, or (2) \"reportable events\" (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K), except for: As previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024 and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the periods in the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company disclosed a material weakness related to the determination of its inventory excess and obsolescence reserve and recoverability of deferred tax assets. As previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024 and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the periods in the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company disclosed a material weakness related to the determination of its inventory excess and obsolescence reserve and recoverability of deferred tax assets. As previously disclosed in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 filed on November 12, 2024, the Company identified certain material weaknesses related to insufficient resources with the appropriate technical accounting expertise to be able to assist in identifying, evaluating and addressing complex technical accounting issues that affect the consolidated financial statements on a timely basis, specifically, the initial failure to properly classify debt and identify impairment triggering events in long-lived assets and goodwill. As previously disclosed in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 filed on November 12, 2024, the Company identified certain material weaknesses related to insufficient resources with the appropriate technical accounting expertise to be able to assist in identifying, evaluating and addressing complex technical accounting issues that affect the consolidated financial statements on a timely basis, specifically, the initial failure to properly classify debt and identify impairment triggering events in long-lived assets and goodwill. As previously disclosed, the Company identified certain material weaknesses in its preliminary assessment of internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, related to Allowance for Credit Losses, Customer Incentives and Information Technology General Controls. As a result, the Company has been delayed in the timely filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as disclosed in the Company's Form NT 10-K filed on March 31, 2025, and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2025, June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2025, as disclosed in the Company's Forms NT-10Q filed on May 15, 2025, August 11, 2025 and November 17, 2025, respectively.

As previously disclosed in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 11, 2025, the Company determined that the Company's previously issued financial statements and related disclosures for (i) the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"Audited Financial Statements\"), and (ii) the interim periods (the \"Unaudited Financial Statements\") included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024 (collectively the \"Non-Reliance Periods\"), should be restated and should no longer be relied upon due to errors in such financial statements primarily related to variable consideration, including the estimates for sales returns and customer rebates, under Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Restated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods have not yet been filed. As previously disclosed in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 11, 2025, the Company determined that the Company's previously issued financial statements and related disclosures for (i) the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"Audited Financial Statements\"), and (ii) the interim periods (the \"Unaudited Financial Statements\") included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024 (collectively the \"Non-Reliance Periods\"), should be restated and should no longer be relied upon due to errors in such financial statements primarily related to variable consideration, including the estimates for sales returns and customer rebates, under Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

Restated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods have not yet been filed. As a result of the errors identified in the Non-Reliance Periods, the Company agreed to restate the related Audited Financial Statements and Unaudited Financial Statements. Grant Thornton was in the process of performing incremental audit procedures related to estimates for customer incentives and sales returns, although such procedures were not completed at the time of their dismissal. As the annual Non-Reliance Periods had been audited by another independent registered public accounting firm, the Company decided that working with two different independent registered public accounting firms is inefficient and difficult to coordinate, and so has appointed BDO USA, PC (\"BDO\") to perform audit services for the restated period and for the year ended December 31, 2024.

On November 12, 2025, the Company filed a Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 with the SEC to allow the Company sufficient time to complete its customary accounting and internal control processes and procedures. Letter states that because the Form 10-Q has not yet been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company no longer meets the continued listing requirements under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of all required periodic reports. Under Nasdaq's rules, the Company has until January 20, 2026, to submit a plan to Nasdaq outlining its strategy to regain compliance. If Nasdaq accepts the plan, the Company may be granted an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the Form 10-Q's original due date, or until May 18, 2026, to regain compliance. Letter further notes that Nasdaq will consider factors including the Company's compliance history, the reasons for the late filing, the likelihood of completing the required filings within the extension period, the Company's financial condition, and any relevant corporate developments during the review period. Nasdaq has also indicated that any subsequent periodic filings due within the potential 180-day extension must also be filed no later than the end of the extension period. Letter does not immediately impact the listing or trading of the Company's common shares on Nasdaq. An indicator reflecting the Company's non-compliance has been posted on Nasdaq's market data dissemination network. Sigma is working diligently to complete the Form 10-Q and intends to submit a compliance plan within the required timeframe.

(Nasdaq: TTSH) (\"Tile Shop\" or the \"Company\"), a specialty retailer of natural stone, man-made and luxury vinyl tiles, setting and maintenance materials and related accessories, today announced that, at the special meeting of stockholders of the Company held on December 3, 2025 (the \"Special Meeting\"), the requisite stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\"), to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's common stock at a ratio not less than 1-for-2,000 and not greater than 1-for-4,000 (the \"Reverse Stock Split\" and such proposal, the \"Reverse Stock Split Proposal\"). Following the approval of the Company's stockholders at the Special Meeting, the Company's Board of Directors approved a ratio of 1-for-3,000 for the Reverse Stock Split followed immediately by a 3,000-for-1 forward stock split of the Company's common stock (the \"Forward Stock Split,\" and together with the Reverse Stock Split, the \"Stock Splits\"). The Company intends to file certificates of amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware to effect the Reverse Stock Split, followed immediately by the Forward Stock Split as promptly as practical following the completion of necessary regulatory processes and thereafter intends to file the necessary documents to delist and deregister the Company. Stockholders who hold fewer than 3,000 shares immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split will be paid $6.60 in cash, without interest, for each whole share of the Company's common stock held by them at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, and thereafter they will no longer be stockholders of the Company. Stockholders owning more than 3,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split (the \"Continuing Stockholders\") will not be entitled to receive any cash for their fractional share interests resulting from the Reverse Stock Split, if any. The Forward Stock Split, which will immediately follow the Reverse Stock Split, will reconvert whole shares and fractional share interests held by the Continuing Stockholders back into the same number of shares of common stock held by such Continuing Stockholders immediately before the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split. As a result of the Forward Stock Split, the total number of shares of the Company's common stock held by a Continuing Stockholder will not change as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. As previously announced, the Company is undertaking the Stock Splits in connection with the proposed delisting of its common stock from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and the deregistration of its common stock under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to avoid the substantial cost and expense of being a public reporting company and to allow the Company to have more time to focus on managing the Company's businesses and undertaking new initiatives that may result in greater long-term growth and increased stockholder value. The Company anticipates savings exceeding $2.4 million on an annual basis as a result of the proposed deregistration and delisting. Additional information about the Stock Splits can be found in the Company's definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 5, 2025.

During 2025, we as a Company met our primary corporate objectives and have conducted and completed a Phase 1b clinical study in CKD patients, where we generated some really fantastic game changing results where we were able to demonstrate that Gemini was able to rebalance a patient's underlying inflammation at the cellular level. This is very important and a significant value creating step for the Company because these results open up the possibility of using Gemini to treat both acute and chronic active inflammation. As we approach the end of 2025, the Company is in a very good financial position, and we will continue to work diligently to advance Gemini. In particular, we are looking forward to our meeting that is scheduled a little bit later this year with the FDA. The primary objective of that meeting is to gain regulatory FDA input on both the clinical and regulatory development pathways for Gemini, particularly as a treatment for acute kidney injury, which is a significant unmet medical need. As we move into 2026 and on the heels of that FDA meeting, of which our objective is to get agreement on the clinical study design ultimately for registration and approval of Gemini to treat acute kidney injury, some of the necessary steps that we'll be taking in 2026 in advance of running that clinical study is building the infrastructure of the Company necessary to run a later stage clinical study. Items included in building up that infrastructure are manufacturing additional Gemini drug product as well as placebo to allow us to run placebo controlled clinical studies in a double-blinded fashion, which means that neither the patient nor the doctor, or any of the other caregivers, know what the patient is actually receiving, as well as building or manufacturing new drug. We are also actively working to identify study investigators - the doctors that actually will be treating these AKI patients, as well as working on contracting with a top-tier clinical research organization which provides, in a cost-effective manner, much of the infrastructure necessary to run a large US based and potentially global-based clinical study. And lastly, I mention that we are talking with FDA about the clinical development pathway and building out the infrastructure with the idea and goal being to start a later stage Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical study in acute kidney injury during the 2026 timeframe. This concludes our brief update and we look forward to talking to you all in the new year.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995985627174377}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9982545971870422}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9978582262992859}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9983803033828735}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9961919784545898}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.5260297060012817}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.7998577952384949}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9973101615905762}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9969809651374817}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9922325611114502}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995610117912292}], "sentiment": "positive"}], "overall_sentiment": "positive", "fully_processed": true, "invalid_reason": null}, "000118518525001916": {"url": "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1077688/000118518525001916/hoft8k120225.htm", "filing_date": "Wed, 3 Dec 2025 17:01:19 EST", "form_type": "8-K", "valid": true, "ticker": "HOFT", "items": {"item 1.01": {"text": "Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On December 1, 2025, Hooker Furnishings Corporation (the \"Company\") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"Asset Purchase Agreement\") with Magnussen Home Furnishings, Inc. (\"Magnussen\") to sell the Company's Pulaski Furniture (\"PFC\") and Samuel Lawrence (\"SLF\") casegoods brands, including specified assets and liabilities related to those brands. Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, at closing, an estimated purchase price will be determined and paid based upon the net book value of the assets being sold in the transaction. As of November 2, 2025, the Company's fiscal third quarter-end, the currently estimated purchase price is approximately $4.8 million subject to final adjustment to closing values, pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Company will also shed approximately $4.8 million in Home Meridian (\"HMI\") showroom lease liabilities and related expenses, as Magnussen will assume the lease of HMI's High Point showroom. The Company will retain the Samuel Lawrence brand in connection with the operation of its hospitality business. The Asset Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of each party. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including third party consents, and is currently expected to close by mid-December 2025. Ten percent of the purchase price paid at closing will be subject to a holdback for 210 days for customary indemnification and final purchase price adjustments. The transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement do not require the approval of the Company's or Magnussen's shareholders. The Company's HMI segment currently has three brands: PFC, SLF and Samuel Lawrence Hospitality (\"SLH\") and the Company is retaining the SLH product line, which is expected to become part of its \"All other\" segment. To accommodate the Company's continued use of the \"Samuel Lawrence Hospitality\" name, Magnussen will license back the use of the name to the Company pursuant to an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid license agreement. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, Magnussen has agreed, for a period of three (3) years following the closing, not to, directly or indirectly, engage or participate in the hospitality business in the U.S. or in any jurisdiction in which the Company or any successor or assign operates. The representations, warranties and covenants included in the Asset Purchase Agreement were made solely for purposes of the agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, including exceptions set forth on confidential disclosure schedules. Accordingly, the Company's shareholders should not rely on such representations, warranties and covenants as characterizations of the actual state of related facts or circumstances, and should bear in mind that such representations, warranties and covenants were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement, were negotiated for purposes of allocating contractual risk among such parties and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality that differ from those generally applicable to shareholders. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change after the date hereof and any such subsequent information may not be fully reflected in the Company's public disclosures.

The primary purpose of amending the Bylaws was to incorporate certain provisions of the Texas Business Organizations Code (\"TBOC\") that were enacted in May 2025. Specifically, the Bylaws were amended to specify that a shareholder may not institute or maintain a derivative proceeding unless that shareholder (as such term is defined in the TBOC) beneficially owns at least 3% of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock (measured on an aggregate basis across all classes of the Company's outstanding shares) at the time such derivative proceeding is instituted. In addition, the Bylaws were amended to provide that the Texas Business Court located in Bexar County, Texas, or if such court lacks jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, or if such court lacks jurisdiction, the state district court of Comal County, Texas, will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain internal entity claims (as defined by the TBOC) unless the Company agrees to a different forum. The amendments to the Bylaws also provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in any legal action, proceeding, cause of action, or counterclaim concerning any internal entity claim and in any other claim, action, or proceeding against the Company or any director, officer, or other employee of the Company. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, these provisions. The amendments to the Bylaws also include various updates, modernizations and conforming changes, including adding provisions that require shareholders to comply with Rule 14a-19 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to nominations of director candidates other than the Company's nominees.

Bonney and Carolyn Bertozzi, Ph.D. provided notice of each of their resignations from the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the \"Company\"), effective on the same date. Neither Mr. Bonney's nor Dr. Bertozzi's respective resignation was caused by any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices. In connection with Mr. Bonney's and Dr. Bertozzi's resignations, the Board approved a decrease in the number of directors constituting the full Board from eleven to ten. On December 2, 2025, the Board elected Stuart A. Arbuckle as a non-employee director of the Company, effective as of January 5, 2026. Mr. Arbuckle will serve as a Class I director to hold office until the Company's 2026 annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. As a non-employee director, Mr. Arbuckle will receive an annual cash retainer of $75,000. In addition, in connection with his election to the Board, Mr. Arbuckle will be granted, on his first date of service on the Board, a stock option to purchase shares of the Company's common stock, $0.01 par value per share (\"Common Stock\"), having an aggregate grant date fair value equal to $600,000 using the Company's then-current Black-Scholes valuation model, and vesting as to one-third of the shares underling the stock option on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the grant date. Following his election, Mr. Arbuckle will be eligible to receive an annual equity award, in an aggregate amount to be determined by the Board upon recommendation of the People, Culture and Compensation Committee. Currently, each of the Company's non-employee directors receives an annual equity award consisting of (i) restricted stock units having an aggregate grant date fair value of $200,000 (determined based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the grant date) and (ii) a stock option to purchase shares of Common stock having an aggregate grant date fair value equal to $200,000 using the Company's then-current Black-Scholes valuation model, and with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the grant date, each vesting in full on the one-year anniversary of the grant date. The Company will also reimburse Mr. Arbuckle for reasonable travel and other related expenses incurred in connection with his service on the Board. In addition, Mr. Arbuckle will enter into an indemnification agreement with the Company consistent with the form of the existing indemnification agreement entered into between the Company and its non-employee directors.

About Vistagen Headquartered in South San Francisco, CA, Vistagen (Nasdaq: VTGN) is a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging a deep understanding of nose-to-brain neurocircuitry to develop and commercialize a new class of intranasal product candidates called pherines. Pherines specifically and selectively bind as agonists on peripheral receptors on human nasal chemosensory neurons and are designed to rapidly trigger olfactory bulb-to-brain neurocircuits believed to regulate brain areas involved in behavior and autonomic nervous system activity.

Commencing with the opening of trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on November 28, 2025, the Company's common stock will trade on a post-split basis under the same trading symbol, \"IVF\". a result of the reverse stock split, the CUSIP number for the Company's common stock will be 44984F807. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 8 shares of issued and outstanding common stock will be exchanged for 1 share of common stock, with any fractional shares being rounded up to the next higher whole share. Immediately after the reverse stock split becomes effective, the company will have approximately 1,891,151 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

About INVO Fertility are a healthcare services fertility company dedicated to expanding assisted reproductive technology (\"ART\") care to patients in need. Our principal commercial strategy is focused on building, acquiring and operating fertility clinics, including \"INVO Centers\" dedicated primarily to offering the intravaginal culture (\"IVC\") procedure enabled by our INVOcell medical device (\"INVOcell\") and US-based, profitable in vitro fertilization (\"IVF\") clinics. We have two operational INVO Centers in the United States and one IVF clinic. We also continue to engage in the sale and distribution of our INVOcell technology solution into third-party owned and operated fertility clinics. The INVOcell is a proprietary and revolutionary medical device, and the first to allow fertilization and early embryo development to take place in vivo within the woman's body. The IVC procedure provides patients with a more natural, intimate, and affordable experience in comparison to other ART treatments. We believe the IVC procedure can deliver comparable results at a fraction of the cost of traditional IVF and is a significantly more effective treatment than intrauterine insemination (\"IUI\").

We refer to these measures as \"non-GAAP financial measures.\" We use these non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for our management and investors to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered supplemental in nature and is not meant to be a substitute for revenue or net income, in each case as recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.

Several transitory headwinds totaling approximately $0.55-0.60 per share impacted the quarter, including: an internal IT and cloud service provider outage ($0.25), lost revenue due to the government shutdown ($0.15), higher fuel costs ($0.15) and a higher book tax rate for the quarter. Following our late October IT outage, we engaged a third-party consultant to conduct a comprehensive audit of our IT infrastructure and processes and are actively implementing best-practice recommendations to strengthen our data center resiliency. The government shutdown that began in October drove FAA-mandated flight reductions, resulting in ~600 cancellations across Air Group, impacting approximately 40,000 guests. While operations normalized quickly after the government reopening, the disruption and lost revenue are expected to reduce EPS by approximately $0.15 for the quarter. Revenue, which had shown the strongest year-over-year performance trends of 2025 prior to the shutdown, turned sharply negative during the period and, although now positive again year-over-year, has not fully recovered to pre-shutdown trends. Despite a volatile year, Air Group has delivered meaningful progress on integration, with disciplined execution keeping us firmly on track with key milestones, synergy capture, and commercial initiatives. Absent transitory impacts, we are exiting the year with unit costs aligned to our original exit-rate expectations and making tangible progress in narrowing the unit revenue gap versus larger network peers. These achievements position us on a strong foundation heading into next year, enabling us to advance strategic priorities and deliver sustained long-term value.

In our opinion, the financial statement presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 26, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Going Concern The accompanying financial statement has been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statement, the Company does not have sufficient cash and working capital to sustain its operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the date of the issuance of the financial statement. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plan in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Basis for Opinion This financial statement is the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statement based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the \"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement is free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statement, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statement. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statement. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ WithumSmith+Brown, PC We have served as the Company's auditor since 2025.

INVEST GREEN ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOVEMBER 26, 2025 Note 1 Organization and Business Operations Invest Green Acquisition Corporation (the \"Company\") is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted corporation on April 7, 2025. The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the \"Business Combination\"). The Company has not selected any specific Business Combination target and the Company has not, nor has anyone on its behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any Business Combination target with respect to an initial Business Combination with the Company. As of November 26, 2025, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from April 7, 2025 (inception) through November 26, 2025 relates to the Company's formation and the initial public offering (the \"Initial Public Offering\"). The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering (as defined below). The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. The registration statement for the Company's Initial Public Offering became effective on November 24, 2025. On November 26, 2025, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 17,250,000 units (the \"Units\" and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the \"Public Shares\"), which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 2,250,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $172,500,000. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one tenth (1/10) of one right (each, a \"Public Right\"). Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 870,000 units (the \"Private Placement Units\") at a price of $5.00 per Private Placement Unit, in a private placement to the Company's sponsor, IG SPAC Sponsor LLC (the \"Sponsor\") and the underwriters, generating gross proceeds of $4,350,000. Of those 870,000 Private Placement Units, the Sponsor purchased 480,000 Private Placement Units, and the underwriters used a portion of their underwriting discount and commission and purchased 390,000 Private Placement Units. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share (each \"Private Placement Share\") and one tenth (1/10) of one right (each \"Private Placement Right\"). Transaction costs amounted to $11,007,737, consisting of $3,450,000 of cash underwriting fee, $6,900,000 of deferred underwriting fee, and $657,737 of other offering costs. The Company's management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be generally applied toward consummating a Business Combination (less deferred underwriting discounts). The Company's Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"Investment Company Act\"). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully complete a Business Combination. INVEST GREEN ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOVEMBER 26, 2025 Note 1 Organization and Business Operations (cont.) Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering, on November 26, 2025, an amount of $172,500,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units and the Private Placement Units was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the \"Trust Account\"), with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (\"CST\") acting as trustee. The funds may only be invested in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations; the holding of these assets in this form is intended to be temporary and for the sole purpose of facilitating the intended Business Combination. To mitigate the risk that the Company might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, which risk increases the longer that the Company holds investments in the Trust Account, the Company may, at any time (based on the management team's ongoing assessment of all factors related to the Company's potential status under the Investment Company Act), instruct the trustee to liquidate the investments held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in cash or in an interest bearing demand deposit account at a bank. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company's initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of the Company's Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or by such earlier liquidation date as the Company's board of directors may approve (the \"Completion Window\"), subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of the Company's Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company's amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the Company's Public Shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the Completion Window or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders' rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company's creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company's public shareholders. The Company will provide the Company's public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the initial Business Combination or (ii) without a shareholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a proposed initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, subject to the limitations. The Public Shares subject to redemption are recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 480, \"Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.\" The Company will have only the duration of the Completion Window to complete the initial Business Combination. However, if the Company is unable to complete its initial Business Combination within the Completion Window, the Company will as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less the amount of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will constitute full and complete payment for the public shares and completely extinguish public shareholders' rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation or other distributions, if any), subject to the Company's obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and subject to the other requirements of applicable law. The Sponsor, officers and directors entered into a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, Private Placement Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination; (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, Private Placement Shares and Public Shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company's amended and restated memorandum and articles of association; (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares and Private Placement Shares if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Completion Window, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Completion Window and to liquidating distributions from assets outside the Trust Account; and (iv) vote any founder shares or Private Placement Shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions, aside from shares they may purchase in compliance with the requirements of Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act, which would not be voted in favor of approving the Business Combination) in favor of the initial Business Combination. INVEST GREEN ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOVEMBER 26, 2025 Note 1 Organization and Business Operations (cont.) The Company's Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement (except for the Company's independent registered public accounting firm), reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company's indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and the Company believes that the Sponsor's only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Going Concern Consideration As of November 26, 2025, the Company had $33,788 cash and working capital of $49,513, and shareholders' deficit of $6,775,487. The Company has since completed its Initial Public Offering at which time capital in excess of the funds deposited in Trust Account and/or used to fund offering expenses was released to the Company for general capital purposes. Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. In connection with the Company's assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB ASC 205-40, \"Financial Statement Presentation Going Concern,\" the Company's management has since reevaluated the Company's liquidity and financial condition, and determined that the Company still lacks the liquidity to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the date of the issuance of the financial statement. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to address this uncertainty with the Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company's plans to complete the Business Combination will be successful. The financial statement does not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statement is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Emerging Growth Company Status The Company is an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \"JOBS Act\"), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company's financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. INVEST GREEN ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOVEMBER 26, 2025 Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statement in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statement, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $33,788 of cash and no cash equivalents as of November 26, 2025. Cash Held in Trust Account As of November 26, 2025, the assets held in the Trust Account, amounting to $172,500,000, were held in cash. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Offering Costs The Company complies with the requirements of FASB ASC 340-10-S99 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A, \"Expenses of Offering.\" Offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees that are related to the Initial Public Offering. FASB ASC 470-20, \"Debt with Conversion and Other Options,\" addresses the allocation of proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt into its equity and debt components. The Company applies this guidance to allocate Initial Public Offering proceeds from the Units between Class A ordinary shares and Share Rights, using the residual method by allocating Initial Public Offering proceeds first to assigned value of the Share Rights and then to the Class A ordinary shares. Offering costs allocated to the Public Shares subject to possible redemption are charged to temporary equity, and offering costs allocated to the Public Rights and Private Placement Units are charged to shareholders' deficit as the Public and Private Placement Rights, after management's evaluation, are accounted for under equity treatment. Transaction costs amounted to $11,007,737, consisting of $3,450,000 of cash underwriting fee, $6,900,000 of deferred underwriting fee, and $657,737 of other offering costs. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC Topic 740, \"Income Taxes,\" which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. FASB ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company's management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company's major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of November 26, 2025, there was no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is considered to be an exempted Cayman Islands company with no connection to any other taxable jurisdiction and is presently not subject to income taxes or income tax filing requirements in the Cayman Islands or the United States. As such, the Company's tax provision was zero for the period presented. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,\" approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature. Share-Based Payment Arrangements The Company accounts for share awards in accordance with FASB ASC 718, \"CompensationStock Compensation,\" which requires that all equity awards be accounted for at their \"fair value.\" Fair value is measured on the grant date and is equal to the underlying value of the share. INVEST GREEN ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOVEMBER 26, 2025 Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.) Costs equal to these fair values are recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the number of awards that are expected to vest, in the period of grant for awards that vest immediately and have no future service condition, or in the period the awards vest immediately after meeting a performance condition becomes probable (i.e., the occurrence of a Business Combination). For awards that vest over time, cumulative adjustments in later periods are recorded to the extent actual forfeitures differ from the Company's initial estimates; previously recognized compensation cost is reversed if the service or performance conditions are not satisfied and the award is forfeited. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, \"Derivatives and Hedging.\" For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statement of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. The underwriters' over-allotment option is deemed to be a freestanding financial instrument indexed on the contingently redeemable shares and will be accounted for as a liability pursuant to FASB ASC 480 if not fully exercised at the time of the Initial Public Offering. On November 26, 2025, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full in the amount of 2,250,000 Units as part of the closing of the Initial Public Offering. As such, as of November 26, 2025, no over-allotment option liability is recognized in the Company's balance sheet. Share Rights The Company accounted for the Public and Private Placement Rights issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the private placement in accordance with the guidance contained in FASB ASC Topic 815, \"Derivatives and Hedging\". Accordingly, the Company evaluated and classified the Share Rights under equity treatment at their assigned values. Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption The Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company's liquidation, or if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company's initial Business Combination. In accordance with FASB ASC 480-10-S99, the Company classifies Public Shares subject to possible redemption outside of permanent equity as the redemption provisions are not solely within the control of the Company. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and will adjust the carrying value of redeemable shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable shares will result in charges against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit. Accordingly, as of November 26, 2025, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders' deficit section of the Company's balance sheet. As of November 26, 2025, the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption reflected in the balance sheet are reconciled in the following table: Gross proceeds 172,500,000 Less: Proceeds allocated to Public Rights (2,811,750 Public Shares issuance costs (10,812,397 Plus: Remeasurement of carrying value to redemption value 13,624,147 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, November 26, 2025 172,500,000 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\" The amendments in this ASU require disclosures, on an annual and interim basis, of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), as well as the aggregate amount of other segment items included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. The ASU requires that a public entity disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Public entities will be required to provide all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods, and entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this ASU and existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 on April 7, 2025, its date of incorporation. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements. INVEST GREEN ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOVEMBER 26, 2025 Note 3 Initial Public Offering Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering on November 26, 2025, the Company sold 17,250,000 Units, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 2,250,000 Units, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one Public Right. Each Public Right entitles the holder thereof to receive one tenth (1/10) of one Class A ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial Business Combination. Note 4 Private Placement Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor and underwriters purchased an aggregate of 870,000 Private Placement Units, at a price of $5.00 per Private Placement Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $4,350,000, from the Company in a private placement. Of those 870,000 Private Placement Units, the Sponsor purchased 480,000 Private Placement Units and the underwriters used a portion of their underwriting discount and commission and purchased 390,000 Private Placement Units. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one Private Placement Share and one Private Placement Right to receive one tenth (1/10) of a Class A ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial Business Combination. The Private Placement Units are identical to the Public Units sold in the Initial Public Offering except that, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Units (including their component securities) (i) may not (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of these Private Placement Rights), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination and (ii) will be entitled to registration rights. The Sponsor, officers and directors entered into a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, Private Placement Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination; (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, Private Placement Shares and Public Shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company's amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the Completion Window or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders' rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity; (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares and Private Placement Shares if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Completion Window, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Completion Window and to liquidating distributions from assets outside the Trust Account; and (iv) vote any founder shares or Private Placement Shares held by them and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions, aside from shares they may purchase in compliance with the requirements of Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act, which would not be voted in favor of approving the Business Combination) in favor of the initial Business Combination. Note 5 Related Party Transactions Founder Shares On June 4, 2025, the Sponsor made a capital contribution of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, for which the Company issued 7,665,900 Class B ordinary shares (the \"Founder Shares\") to the Sponsor. On September 17, 2025, the Sponsor surrendered 1,915,900 Founder Shares for no consideration, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 5,750,000 Founder Shares (up to 750,000 shares of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised). All share and per-share amounts have been retrospectively presented. On November 26, 2025, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full and as a result, the 750,000 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. On November 15, 2025, the Sponsor transferred a total of 422,000 membership interests in the Sponsor representing interests in 422,000 Founder Shares to the four independent directors. The transfer of the membership interests to independent directors are in the scope of FASB ASC Topic 718, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation\" (\"FASB ASC 718\"). Under FASB ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the assignment date. The fair value of the membership interests in 422,000 Founder Shares granted to the Company's independent directors on the grant date has an aggregate total of $746,940, or $1.77 per share. The transfer of membership interests has no service restrictions; thus, the total fair value of $746,940 was recorded as compensation expense on the grant date. The third-party valuation firm valued the membership interests in the Founder Shares as of November 15, 2025 using backsolve approach and classified as Level 3 at the measurement date due to the use of unobservable inputs including the probability of a Business Combination and other risk factors. The market adjustment was 18.0% (the market adjustment reflects additional risk, which may include the likelihood of Business Combination occurring, market perception of lack of available or suitable targets, or possible post-acquisition decline of share price prior to beginning of exercise period); the implied Class A share price was $9.82; Share Rights fraction was 1/10; and pre-adjusted value per share right was $0.98. INVEST GREEN ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOVEMBER 26, 2025 Note 5 Related Party Transactions (cont.) The Company's initial shareholders agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares and any Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of (i) six months after the completion of the initial Business Combination or (ii) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction after the initial Business Combination that results in all of the Company's shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of the Company's initial shareholders with respect to any Founder Shares (the \"Lock-up\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (1) the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial Business Combination or (2) if the Company consummates a transaction after the initial Business Combination which results in the Company's shareholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property, the founder shares will be released from the Lock-up. Promissory Note Related Party On June 4, 2025, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to $500,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the \"Promissory Note\"). The loan is non-interest bearing and unsecured. The Promissory Note is payable on the earlier of December 31, 2025 or the date on which the Company consummates the Initial Public Offering of its securities. As of November 26, 2025, the Company had borrowed $256,332, which has been paid in full by the Company at the closing of the Initial Public Offering and borrowings under the Promissory Note are no longer available. Working Capital Loans In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Company's officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the \"Working Capital Loans\"). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to $3,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into Private Placement Units of the post Business Combination entity at a price of $5.00 per Private Placement Unit at the option of the lender. As of November 26, 2025, no such Working Capital Loans were outstanding. Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies Risks and Uncertainties The Company's ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control. The Company's ability to consummate an initial Business Combination could be impacted by, among other things, changes in laws or regulations, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, inflation, fluctuations in interest rates, increases in tariffs, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The Company cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact the Company's ability to complete an initial Business Combination. Registration Rights The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Units and the Class A ordinary shares underlying such Private Placement Units and Private Placement Rights and units that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans will have registration rights to require the Company to register a sale of any of the Company's securities held by them and any other securities of the Company acquired by them prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed on the effective date of the Initial Public Offering. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, so that the Company registers such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggyback registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of the initial Business Combination. The underwriters and/or their designees may not exercise their demand and piggyback registration rights after five and seven years after the commencement of the Initial Public Offering and may not exercise their demand rights on more than one occasion. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. INVEST GREEN ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOVEMBER 26, 2025 Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies (cont.) Underwriters' Agreement The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to an additional 2,250,000 Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On November 26, 2025, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full as part of the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The underwriters were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit, or $3,450,000 in the aggregate. Of this amount, (i) $0.10 per Unit, or $1,500,000 in the aggregate was paid to the underwriters in cash and (ii) $0.10 per Unit was used by the underwriters to purchase Private Placement Units, or $1,950,000 in the aggregate. Additionally, the underwriters were entitled to a deferred underwriting discount of $0.40 per Unit, or $6,900,000 in the aggregate payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions on amounts remaining in the Trust Account after all redemptions by public shareholders have been met. The deferred underwriting discount will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event the Company completes its Initial Business Combination. Note 7 Shareholders' Deficit Preference Shares The Company is authorized to issue a total of 5,000,000 preference shares with par value of $0.0001 per share. At November 26, 2025, there were no preference shares issued or outstanding. Class A Ordinary Shares The Company is authorized to issue a total of 500,000,000 Class A ordinary shares with par value of $0.0001 per share. At November 26, 2025, there were 870,000 Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding, excluding 17,250,000 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption. Class B Ordinary Shares The Company is authorized to issue a total of 50,000,000 Class B ordinary shares with par value of $0.0001 per share. On June 4, 2025, the Company issued 7,665,900 Class B ordinary shares to the Sponsor for $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. On September 17, 2025, the Sponsor surrendered 1,915,900 Founder Shares for no consideration, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 5,750,000 Founder Shares (up to 750,000 shares of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised). All share and per-share amounts have been retrospectively presented. On November 26, 2025, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full and as a result, the 750,000 Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. The Founder Shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of the initial Business Combination or earlier at the option of the holder on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or any other equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts sold in the Initial Public Offering and related to or in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination, the ratio at which Class B ordinary shares convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, approximately 25% of the sum of (i) the total number of all Class A ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering (excluding the Class A ordinary shares underlying the Private Placement Units), plus (ii) all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued, in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination and any private placement-equivalent shares issued to the Sponsor or any of its affiliates or to the Company's officers or directors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans) minus (iii) any redemptions of Class A ordinary shares by public shareholders in connection with charter amendments prior to an initial Business Combination or an initial Business Combination; provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. INVEST GREEN ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOVEMBER 26, 2025 Note 7 Shareholder's Equity (Deficit) (cont.) Holders of record of the Company's Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Unless specified in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or as required by the Companies Act or stock exchange rules, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law and the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, which requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast by such shareholders as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy at the applicable general meeting of the company is generally required to approve any matter voted on by the Company's shareholders. Approval of certain actions requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, which (except as specified below) requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes cast by such shareholders as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy at the applicable general meeting, and pursuant to the Company's amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, such actions include amending the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approving a statutory merger or consolidation with another company. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the appointment of directors, meaning, following the Company's initial Business Combination, the holders of more than 50% of the ordinary shares voted for the appointment of directors can elect all of the directors. Prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, only holders of the Class B ordinary shares will (i) have the right to vote on the appointment and removal of directors and (ii) be entitled to vote on continuing the Company in a jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands (including any special resolution required to amend the constitutional documents or to adopt new constitutional documents, in each case, as a result of approving a transfer by way of continuation in a jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands). Holders of the Class A ordinary shares will not be entitled to vote on these matters during such time. These provisions of the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended if approved by a special resolution passed by the affirmative vote of at least 90% (or, where such amendment is proposed in respect of the consummation of the initial Business Combination, two-thirds) of the votes cast by such shareholders as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or, where proxies are allowed, by proxy at the applicable general meeting of the Company. Share Rights Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a Business Combination, each holder of a right will automatically receive one tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon consummation of the initial Business Combination. The Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of Cayman law. In the event the Company is not the surviving company upon completion of the initial Business Combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her or its rights in order to receive the one tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share underlying each right upon consummation of the Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company will redeem the Public Shares for the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds for their rights and the rights will expire worthless. Note 8 Segment Information FASB ASC Topic 280, \"Segment Reporting,\" establishes standards for companies to report, in their financial statement, information about operating segments, products, services, geographic areas, and major customers. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which it may recognize revenues and incur expenses, and for which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the Company's CODM, or group, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company's CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews the operating results for the Company as a whole to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing financial performance. Accordingly, management has determined that the Company only has one reportable segment. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total assets. When evaluating the Company's performance and making key decisions regarding resource allocation, CODM reviews several key metrics, which include the following: November 26, 33,788 Prepaid expenses 90,725 Cash held in Trust Account 172,500,000 The CODM reviews the position of total assets to assess if the Company has sufficient resources available to discharge its liabilities. The CODM is provided with details of cash and liquid resources available with the Company. The CODM will review the interest that will be earned and accrued on cash held in Trust Account to measure and monitor shareholder value and determine the most effective strategy of investment with the Trust Account funds while maintaining compliance with the Trust Agreement. INVEST GREEN ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOVEMBER 26, 2025 Note 9 Fair Value Measurements The fair value of the Company's financial assets and liabilities reflects management's estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities: Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair value of the Public Rights issued in the Initial Public Offering is $2,811,750, or $0.163 per Public Right. The fair value of the Public Rights was determined using backsolve approach to separate the publicly traded Unit price into its constituent securities (Class A ordinary shares and Share Rights). The Public Rights issued in the Initial Public Offering have been classified within shareholders' deficit and will not require remeasurement after issuance. The following table presents the quantitative information regarding market assumptions used in the \"Level 3\" valuation of the Public Rights issued in the Initial Public Offering: November 26, Unit price 10.01 Share price Share Rights fraction Pre-adjusted value per Right Market adjustment Market adjustment reflects additional factors not fully captured by low volatility selection, which may include likelihood of a Business Combination occurring, market perception of lack of available or suitable targets, or possible post-acquisition decline of share price prior to the beginning of the exercise period. The adjustment is determined by comparing traded Public Right prices to simulated model outputs. The market adjustment was determined by calibrating traded Public Rights prices as of the valuation dates. Note 10 Subsequent Events The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to December 3, 2025, the date that the financial statement was issued. Based on this review, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statement.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral",

PHILADELPHIA December 3, 2025 Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) today announced that its Board of Directors (the \"Board\") has approved the previously announced separation of a strong portfolio of cable television networks and complementary digital platforms from its remaining businesses, and the creation of an independent, publicly traded company named Versant Media Group, Inc. (\"Versant\"). The separation will be achieved through pro rata distribution of 100% of the outstanding shares of Versant Class A common stock and Versant Class B common stock to the holders of Comcast Class A common stock and Comcast Class B common stock. Comcast shareholders will receive one share of Versant Class A common stock or Versant Class B common stock for every 25 shares of Comcast Class A common stock or Comcast Class B common stock, respectively, held at the close of business on the record date of December 16, 2025 (the \"record date\"). The distribution of Versant shares is expected to be completed after the close of trading on Nasdaq on January 2, 2026 (the \"distribution date\"). The holders of Comcast Class A common stock entitled to receive the distribution will receive a book-entry account statement or a credit to their brokerage account reflecting their ownership of Versant Class A common stock. No action is required by Comcast shareholders to receive Versant shares in the distribution. Fractional shares of Versant common stock will not be distributed. Any fractional share of Versant Class A common stock otherwise issuable to a holder of Comcast Class A common stock will be sold in the open market on such shareholder's behalf, and such holder will receive a cash payment for the fractional share based on its pro rata portion of the net cash proceeds from all sales of fractional shares. Prior to the distribution, Comcast expects to deliver an information statement to all shareholders entitled to receive the distribution. The information statement will describe Versant, including the risks of owning Versant common stock and other details regarding the separation. The completion of the distribution is subject to a number of customary conditions, including that no event or development will have occurred or exist that, in the judgment of the Board, in its sole discretion, makes it inadvisable to effect the distribution. Comcast expects to receive an opinion from its tax advisor confirming the tax-free status of the separation to Comcast and its shareholders (except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares). Comcast expects that a \"when-issued\" public trading market for Versant Class A common stock will commence on or about December 15, 2025 under the symbol \"VSNTV\", and will continue through the distribution date. Comcast also anticipates that \"regular-way\" trading of Versant Class A common stock will begin on January 5, 2026, the first trading day following the distribution date. Beginning on or about December 15, 2025, and through the distribution date, it is expected that there will be two ways to trade Comcast Class A common stock either with or without the distribution of Versant Class A common stock. Comcast shareholders who sell their shares of Comcast Class A common stock in the \"regular-way\" market (that is, the normal trading market under the symbol \"CMCSA\") after the record date and on or prior to the distribution date will be selling their right to receive shares of Versant Class A common stock in connection with the separation. Alternatively, Comcast shareholders who sell their shares of Comcast Class A common stock in the \"ex-distribution\" market during the same period -more- under the symbol \"CMCSV\" will not be selling their right to receive shares of Versant Class A common stock in connection with the separation. Investors are encouraged to consult with their financial advisors regarding the specific implications of buying or selling shares of Comcast Class A common stock on or before the distribution date. Following the distribution, Versant will be an independent, publicly traded company. Versant has received approval for the listing of its common stock on Nasdaq under the symbol \"VSNT,\" subject to official notice of issuance. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are serving as financial advisors to Comcast, and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP is serving as legal counsel.

REPORTS 2025 THIRD QUARTER REPORTED REVENUE AND EARNINGS ABOVE GUIDANCE; NARROWS FULL YEAR REPORTED REVENUE AND NON-GAAP EPS OUTLOOK TO HIGH END OF PREVIOUS RANGES Third quarter Revenue: Increased 2% to $2.294 billion compared to the prior year period and exceeded guidance of flat to increase slightly. Decreased less than 1% on a constant currency basis, in line with guidance of a slight decrease. GAAP basis: $0.09. Results include $22 million of pre-tax restructuring costs and other tax related impacts, which have been excluded from the Company's results on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP basis: $2.83 exceeded guidance of $2.35 to $2.50. Full year outlook Revenue: Narrows outlook to up low single-digits compared to increase slightly to up low single-digits previously. Reaffirms outlook of flat to increase slightly on a constant currency basis. Operating margin: Reaffirms outlook of approximately 8.5% on a non-GAAP basis. EPS: Narrows outlook to a range of $10.85 to $11.00 on a non-GAAP basis compared to $10.75 to $11.00 previously. Outlook includes: an estimated net negative impact related to the tariffs currently in place for goods coming into the U.S., including an unmitigated impact of approximately $1.05 per share compared to approximately $1.15 per share previously and a partially offsetting impact of planned mitigation actions an estimated positive impact of approximately $0.45 per share related to foreign currency translation in line with previous guidance New York December 3, 2025 - PVH Corp. [NYSE: PVH] today reported its 2025 third quarter results and 2025 outlook. Stefan Larsson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"In the third quarter, we exceeded our guidance across reported revenue, operating margin and EPS, and delivered constant-currency revenue in line with expectations. Through disciplined PVH+ Plan execution, we continued to lean into the iconic brand strength of Calvin Klein TOMMY HILFIGER , expanding innovation across product and delivering cut-through marketing. Calvin drove growth in key categories like underwear and fashion denim, while Tommy Hilfiger delivered growth in core lifestyle categories, elevating style icons through the Hilfiger Racing Club campaign.\" Larsson continued, \"In Europe, we saw a tougher backdrop entering the fall, while in the Americas, our digital channels continued to outperform, and in APAC we again exceeded expectations, driven by strong DTC performance with a notable improvement in China. Despite the continued uneven global consumer environment, we delivered an on-plan start to the Holiday season and Black Friday week in both Europe and North America. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our data- and demand-driven supply chain, reflected in healthy inventory levels. We are also investing in key growth initiatives, especially marketing, and freed up over 200 basis points in SG&A efficiencies over the past 18 months. Looking ahead, we are reaffirming our full-year constant currency revenue and operating margin outlook and narrowing our reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS outlook to the high end of our previous ranges, reflecting our confidence in our brands.\" Zac Coughlin, Chief Financial Officer, said, \"For the third quarter, we delivered on our overall revenue plan and exceeded our EPS guidance despite an ongoing choppy macroeconomic backdrop, and we are narrowing our full year reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance towards the high-end of our prior ranges. We continue to manage our business prudently, investing in key brand accretive investments, and have unlocked significant cost efficiencies through our Growth Driver 5 actions.\" Non-GAAP Amounts: Amounts stated to be on a non-GAAP basis exclude the items that are defined or described in greater detail near the end of this release under the heading \"Non-GAAP Exclusions.\" Amounts stated on a constant currency basis also are deemed to be on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of amounts on a GAAP basis to amounts on a non-GAAP basis are presented after the Non-GAAP Exclusions section and identify and quantify all excluded items. Third Quarter Review: Revenue $2.294 billion increased 2% compared to $2.255 billion in the prior year period (decreased less than 1% on a constant currency basis). Revenue performance for the Company's reportable segments in the third quarter compared to the prior year period was as follows: revenue increased 4% compared to the prior year period (decreased 2% on a constant currency basis). The decrease in revenue on a constant currency basis was driven by declines in both the direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses. Americas revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year period, driven by growth in the wholesale business, partially offset by a decrease in the direct-to-consumer business. The increase in wholesale revenue included the transition of previously licensed women's product categories in-house, partially offset by the timing of prior year wholesale shipments which were more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. revenue decreased 1% compared to the prior year period (flat on a constant currency basis). On a constant currency basis, growth in the direct-to-consumer business was offset by a decrease in the wholesale business. Licensing revenue decreased 11% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the transition of certain previously licensed women's product categories in-house. Revenue performance for the Company's global brand businesses in the third quarter compared to the prior year period was as follows: Tommy Hilfiger revenue increased 1% compared to the prior year period (decreased 2% on a constant currency basis). Calvin Klein revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year period (flat on a constant currency basis). Revenue performance for the Company's directly operated channels in the third quarter compared to the prior year period was as follows: Direct-to-consumer revenue was flat compared to the prior year period (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis). Owned and operated store revenue was flat compared to the prior year period (decreased 2% on a constant currency basis). On a constant currency basis, revenue growth in APAC was more than offset by a decline in Americas and EMEA. Owned and operated digital commerce revenue increased 1% compared to the prior year period (flat on a constant currency basis). On a constant currency basis, revenue growth in Americas and APAC was offset by a decline in EMEA. Wholesale revenue increased 4% compared to the prior year period (increased 1% on a constant currency basis), primarily driven by the increase in Americas partially offset by the decreases in APAC and EMEA as discussed above Gross margin was 56.3% compared to 58.4% in the prior year period. The decrease reflects the impacts of (i) increased tariffs on goods coming into the U.S., (ii) an increased promotional environment, (iii) the gross margin differential due to the transition of previously licensed women's product categories to an in-house wholesale business, and (iv) higher freight costs and incremental discounts provided to customers to address the impact of Calvin Klein product delivery delays. Inventory increased 3% compared to the prior year period, reflecting a significant improvement as compared to the increase in the second quarter of 2025, and includes a 2% impact of increased tariffs. Earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") on a GAAP basis was $181 million, inclusive of a $8 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency translation, compared to $183 million in the prior year period. EBIT on a GAAP basis included costs of $22 million in the third quarter and net costs of $53 million in the prior year period described under the heading \"Non-GAAP Exclusions\" later in this release. EBIT on a non-GAAP basis for these periods excludes these amounts. EBIT on a non-GAAP basis was $202 million, inclusive of the $8 million positive impact attributable to foreign currency translation, compared to $236 million in the prior year period. The decrease was more than explained by the gross margin decline discussed above. The Company continues to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses, driving cost efficiencies while making targeted investments to drive its strategic initiatives. Earnings per share (\"EPS\") GAAP basis : $0.09 compared to $2.34 in the prior year period. Non-GAAP basis : $2.83 compared to $3.03 in the prior year period. Previous guidance was $2.35 to $2.50. EPS on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2025 includes: a net negative impact related to the tariffs currently in place for goods coming into the U.S., including an unmitigated impact of approximately $0.37 per share and a partially offsetting impact of mitigation actions the positive impact of $0.14 per share related to foreign currency translation EPS on a GAAP basis for these periods also includes the amounts for the applicable period described under the heading \"Non-GAAP Exclusions\" later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis for these periods excludes these amounts. Net interest expense increased to $21 million from $16 million in the prior year period primarily due to the impact of the accelerated share repurchase agreements discussed below. Effective tax rate was 97.4% on a GAAP basis compared to 21.0% in the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 25.5% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 22.6% in the prior year period. The effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2025 includes the impact of the $480 million pre-tax noncash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges that were recorded in the first quarter of 2025, which are non-deductible for tax purposes and factored into the Company's annualized effective tax rate. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis for the third quarter of 2025 excludes this impact. Stock Repurchase Program: Delivering on its commitment under the PVH+ Plan to return excess cash to stockholders, the Company repurchased 5.4 million shares of its common stock for $561 million in the first quarter through accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") agreements and open market purchases. During the third quarter of 2025, the ASR agreements were settled and the Company received an additional 2.3 million shares of its common stock, bringing the total shares repurchased to 7.7 million for the first nine months of 2025. The Company did not make any payments to repurchase its common stock during the second and third quarters of 2025. 2025 Outlook: The Company's 2025 outlook reflects an estimated net negative impact related to the tariffs currently in place for goods coming into the U.S., including an approximately $65 million unmitigated impact to full year 2025 EBIT, or approximately $1.05 per share, and a partially offsetting impact of planned mitigation actions which began in the third quarter of 2025 and will more significantly take effect in the fourth quarter of 2025. There is significant uncertainty with respect to global trade policies and the related impact on the broader macroeconomic environment and, as such, the Company's 2025 outlook could be subject to material change. Full Year 2025 Guidance Revenue: Narrowing outlook to up low single-digits compared to increase slightly to up low single-digits previously. Reaffirming outlook of flat to increase slightly on a constant currency basis. Operating margin: Reaffirming outlook of approximately 8.5% on a non-GAAP basis compared to 8.9% on a GAAP basis and 10.0% on a non-GAAP basis in 2024. Narrowing outlook to a range of $10.85 to $11.00 on a non-GAAP basis compared to $10.75 to $11.00 previously. EPS was $10.56 on a GAAP basis and $11.74 on a non-GAAP basis in 2024 The 2025 EPS projection includes: an estimated net negative impact related to the tariffs currently in place for goods coming into the U.S., including an unmitigated impact of approximately $1.05 per share compared to approximately $1.15 previously and a partially offsetting impact of planned mitigation actions the estimated positive impact of approximately $0.45 per share related to foreign currency translation EPS on a GAAP basis for 2024 includes the amounts described under the heading \"Non-GAAP Exclusions\" later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis for 2024 excludes these amounts. Net interest expense is projected to increase to approximately $80 million compared to $67 million in 2024, primarily due to the impact of the ASR agreements discussed above. Effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% on a non-GAAP basis. Fourth Quarter 2025 Guidance Revenue: Projected to increase slightly to up low single-digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 (decrease slightly on a constant currency basis). Projected to be in a range of $3.20 to $3.35 on a non-GAAP basis compared to $2.83 on a GAAP basis and $3.27 on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter of 2024. The fourth quarter 2025 EPS projection includes: an estimated net negative impact related to the tariffs currently in place for goods coming into the U.S., including an unmitigated impact of approximately $0.60 per share and a partially offsetting impact of planned mitigation actions the estimated positive impact of approximately $0.20 per share related to foreign currency translation EPS on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter of 2024 includes the amounts described under the heading \"Non-GAAP Exclusions\" later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter of 2024 excludes these amounts. Net interest expense is projected to increase to approximately $20 million compared to $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily due to the impact of the accelerated share repurchase agreements discussed above. Effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% on a non-GAAP basis. The Company is unable to project full year 2025 operating margin and full year and fourth quarter 2025 EPS and effective tax rate on a GAAP basis without unreasonable efforts as there are significant uncertainties with respect to (i) the amount and timing of the restructuring costs to be incurred during 2025 in connection with the multiyear Growth Driver 5 Actions defined later in this release and (ii) the actuarial gain or loss on the Company's retirement plans, to be recorded in the fourth quarter 2025, due to volatility in the financial markets. As such, the Company is unable to provide a full reconciliation of its full year 2025 operating margin and full year and fourth quarter 2025 EPS and effective tax rate guidance on a non-GAAP basis to the corresponding measures on a GAAP basis. See Non-GAAP Exclusions below for items recorded in the first, second and third quarters of 2025. Please see the section entitled \"Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts\" at the end of this release for further detail and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts discussed in this section. Non-GAAP Exclusions: The discussions in this release that refer to non-GAAP amounts exclude the following: Pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $80 million incurred in 2025 consisting principally of severance in connection with the Company's multiyear initiative announced in 2024 to simplify its operating model by centralizing processes and improving systems and automation to drive more efficient, cost-effective ways of working across the organization (the \"Growth Driver 5 Actions\"), of which $13 million was incurred in the first quarter, $45 million was incurred in the second quarter and $22 million was incurred in the third quarter. Pre-tax noncash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $480 million recorded in the first quarter of 2025, which were primarily due to a significant increase in discount rates. Pre-tax loss of $28 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 related to the recognized actuarial loss on retirement plans. Pre-tax net restructuring costs totaling $24 million incurred in 2024 consisting principally of severance and the gain on the sale of a warehouse and distribution center in the third quarter in connection with the Growth Driver 5 Actions, of which $15 million was incurred in the second quarter, $3 million was incurred in the third quarter, and $6 million was incurred in the fourth quarter. Pre-tax costs of $51 million incurred in the third quarter of 2024 in connection with an amendment to Mr. Tommy Hilfiger's employment agreement pursuant to which the Company made a cash buyout of a portion of future payments to Mr. Hilfiger. Pre-tax gain of $10 million recorded in the first quarter of 2024 in connection with the Company's sale of the Heritage Brands women's intimates business. Estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax items, which are based on the Company's assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated each item that it had identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item was (i) taxable or tax deductible, in which case the tax effect was taken at the applicable income tax rate in the local jurisdiction, or (ii) non-taxable or non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed no tax effect. The Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies and reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and can have a significant impact on the Company's reported revenues. The Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the relevant period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the relevant period). The Company presents non-GAAP financial measures, including constant currency revenue information, as a supplement to its GAAP results. The Company believes presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of non-recurring and non-operational amounts and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable, and (i) facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company's Board of Directors and others. The Company's results excluding non-recurring and non-operational amounts are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company's operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies. Please see tables 1 through 7 and the sections entitled \"Reconciliations of Constant Currency Revenue\" and \"Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts\" later in this release for reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts.
