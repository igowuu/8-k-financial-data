Ronan Kennedy, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The term of the Agreement commenced on November 28, 2025 and expires three years thereafter and may be extended for additional one-year periods unless terminated. The Company will pay Mr. Kennedy a base salary of $340,000. The Company also granted Mr. Kennedy a restricted stock award for 445,000 shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to the Company's 2025 Equity Compensation Plan (the \"2025 Plan\") disclosed below. The vesting and issuance of the shares is subject to shareholder approval. The description of the Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Agreement filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 which is incorporated by reference into this Item 5.02. On November 28, 2025, the board of directors of the Company approved the 2025 Plan, as the Company's 2015 Equity Compensation Plan has expired and there is a nominal number of shares available under the Company's 2021 Equity Compensation Plan. Our board of directors will recommend that the 2025 Plan be approved by our shareholders at our upcoming 2026 annual meeting. The purpose of the 2025 Plan is to enable the Company to offer to its employees, officers, directors and consultants whose past, present and/or potential contributions to the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, are or will be important to the success of the Company, an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company. The 2025 Plan reserves 891,316 shares of our common stock for issuance pursuant to the terms of the plan upon the grant of plan options, restricted stock awards, or other stock-based awards granted under the 2025 Plan. The 2025 Plan also contains an \"evergreen formula\" pursuant to which the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2025 Plan will automatically increase on October 1 of each calendar year during the term of the 2025 Plan, beginning with calendar year 2026, (i) by an amount equal to 2% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on September 30 of the such calendar year, up to a maximum of 300,000 shares or (ii) to no more than 10% of the then number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock as of the date of such increase. The 2025 Plan will be administered by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of our board of directors. Such committee is comprised of independent member of our board of directors in accordance with the rules of the NYSE American LLC, the exchange on which our common stock is presently listed. The Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will determine, from time to time, those of individuals to whom stock awards or plan options will be granted, the terms and provisions of each such grant, the dates such grants will become exercisable, the number of shares subject to each grant, the purchase price of such shares and the form of payment of such purchase price. All other questions relating to the administration of the 2025 Plan and the interpretation of the provisions thereof are to be resolved at the sole discretion of the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The 2025 Plan provides for the grant of restricted stock awards, deferred stock grants, stock appreciation rights, incentive stock options (\"ISOs\") and non-qualified stock options (\"NQOs\"). Awards may be made or granted to our employees, officers, directors and consultants who are deemed to have rendered or to be able to render significant services to the Company or our subsidiaries and who are deemed to have contributed or to have the potential to contribute to the success of our company. Any plan option granted under the 2025 Plan must provide for an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of such grant, but the exercise price of any ISO granted to an eligible employee owning more than 10% of our common stock must be at least 110% of such fair market value as determined on the date of the grant. No ISOs may be granted to any person who is not an employee of the Company or a subsidiary at the time of grant. The recipient of any grant under the 2025 Plan, and the amount and terms of a specific grant, will be determined by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The term of each plan option will be fixed by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee; provided, however , that an ISO may be granted only within the 10-year period commencing from the date of adoption of the 2025 Plan by our board of directors and may only be exercised within 10 years of the date of grant, or five years in the case of an ISO granted to an optionee who, at the time of grant, owns shares of our common stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company. The exercise price per share of common stock purchasable under a plan option will be determined by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee at the time of grant and may not be less than 100% of the fair market value on the day of grant, or, in the case of a grant of an ISO to a 10% or greater shareholder, not be less than 110% of the fair market value on the date of grant. provided, however Shares of restricted stock may be awarded either alone or in addition to other awards granted under the 2025 Plan. The Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, subject to board of directors authorization, if indicated, may determine the eligible persons to whom, and the time or times at which, grants of restricted stock will be awarded, the number of shares to be awarded, the price (if any) to be paid by the holder, the time or times within which such awards may be subject to forfeiture, the vesting schedule and rights to acceleration thereof, and all other terms and conditions of the awards. Restricted stock will constitute issued and outstanding shares of our common stock for all corporate purposes. The holder will have the right to vote such restricted stock, to receive and retain all regular cash dividends and other cash equivalent distributions as the board of directors may in its sole discretion designate, pay or distribute on such restricted stock and to exercise all other rights, powers and privileges of a holder of common stock with respect to such restricted stock, with the exceptions that (i) the holder will not be entitled to delivery of the stock certificate or certificates representing such restricted stock until the restriction period, if any, has expired and unless all other vesting requirements with respect thereto shall have been fulfilled; (ii) the Company will retain custody of the stock certificate or certificates representing the restricted stock during the restriction period; (iii) other than regular cash dividends and other cash equivalent distributions as the board of directors may in its sole discretion designate, pay or distribute, we will retain custody of all distributions made or declared with respect to the restricted stock until such time, if ever, as the restricted stock with respect to which such retained distributions may be made, paid or declared has become vested; (iv) such award has not been forfeited. Other stock-based awards may be awarded, subject to limitations under applicable law, that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, or related to, shares of common stock, as deemed by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to be consistent with the purposes of the 2025 Plan, including, without limitation, purchase rights, shares of common stock awarded which are not subject to any restrictions or conditions, or other rights convertible into shares of common stock and awards valued by reference to the value of securities of or the performance of specified subsidiaries. Other stock-based awards may be awarded either alone or in addition to or in tandem with any other awards under the 2025 Plan or any other plan of the Company. Each other stock-based award will be subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The 2025 Plan became effective on the date of its adoption by our board of directors. To the extent that the 2025 Plan authorizes the award of ISOs, the failure to obtain shareholder approval for the 2025 Plan by November 28, 2025 does not invalidate the 2025 Plan; provided, however , that (i) in the absence of such shareholder approval, ISOs may not be awarded under the 2025 Plan and (ii) any ISOs previously awarded under the 2025 Plan will automatically be converted into NQOs upon terms and conditions determined by the Compensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to reflect, as nearly as is reasonably practicable in its sole determination, the terms and conditions of the ISOs so converted. Furthermore, grants under the 2025 Plan will not vest until shareholder approval is received. Our board of directors may at any time, and from time to time, amend alter, suspend or discontinue any of the provisions of the 2025 Plan, but no amendment, alteration, suspension or discontinuance may be made that would impair the rights of a holder of any outstanding grant or award under the 2025 without such holder's consent. Unless the 2025 Plan is suspended or terminated by the board of directors, the 2025 Plan will terminate 10 years from the date of its adoption. Any termination of the 2025 Plan will not affect the validity of any options previously granted thereunder.

The Amendment revises the retention and compensation structure previously established for Mr. Dinenberg, establishing a six-month retention period, beginning March 16, 2026 (the \"Effective Date\") and ending September 15, 2026 (the \"Term\"), as the Company continues to execute on its plan of sale.

As previously reported, on September 1, 2025, Air Lease Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the \"Company\" or \"Air Lease\"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\"), with Sumisho Air Lease Corporation Designated Activity Company (formerly known as Gladiatora Designated Activity Company), an Irish private limited company (\"Parent\"), and Takeoff Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (\"Merger Sub\"), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the conditions contained in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent is a new holding company established by Sumitomo Corporation, a Japanese corporation (\"Sumitomo\"), SMBC Aviation Capital Limited, a company incorporated with limited liability in Ireland (\"SMBC AC\"), affiliates of Apollo Capital Management, L.P. (\"Apollo\") and affiliates of Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. (\"Brookfield\" and, together with Apollo, SMBC and Sumitomo, the \"Equity Investors\"). Explanatory Note On October 15, 2025, the Company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A (the \"Preliminary Proxy Statement\") in connection with the special meeting of the Company's Class A common stockholders scheduled to be held on December 18, 2025 (the \"Special Meeting\") to, among other things, consider and vote on a proposal to adopt and approve the Merger Agreement. On November 4, 2025, the Company filed with the SEC a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A (as supplemented from time to time, the \"Definitive Proxy Statement\"), which the Company first mailed to its Class A common stockholders on or about November 7, 2025. The Company is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to update and supplement the Definitive Proxy Statement. 8-K On November 12, 2025, a purported Class A common stockholder of the Company (the \"Delaware Plaintiff\") filed a lawsuit against the Company and each member of the Company's Board of Directors in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (the \"Delaware Complaint\"). The Delaware Complaint, captioned Bingham v. Air Lease Corp. , C.A. No. 2025-1308-BWD (Del. Ch. 2025), asserts claims under Delaware law for breach of fiduciary duties against each member of the Company's Board of Directors related to alleged materially misleading and/or incomplete disclosures in the Definitive Proxy Statement concerning the Company's financial projections, the analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan, discussions about post-transaction employment and prior representations by the Company's legal advisor of Brookfield. The Delaware Plaintiff also seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent the Company from proceeding with holding the Class A common stockholder vote on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting. Bingham v. Air Lease Corp. 2025-1308-BWD On November 24, 2025, two purported Class A common stockholders of the Company filed separate lawsuits against the Company and each member of the Company's Board of Directors in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in New York County (the \"New York Complaints\" and together with the Delaware Complaint, the \"Complaints\"). The New York Complaints, captioned Williams v. Air Lease Corp. , No. 659969/2025 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2025) and Thomas v. Air Lease Corp. , No. 659966/2025 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2025), respectively, each assert claims under New York common law for negligent misrepresentation and concealment and general negligence, concerning the Definitive Proxy Statement, including allegedly misleading and/or incomplete disclosures concerning the Company's financial projections, the analyses conducted by J.P. Morgan, discussions about post-transaction employment and concurrent representations by the Company's financial advisor and its affiliates of Appollo and its affiliates. The New York Complaints also seek to enjoin the merger until supplemental disclosures to the Definitive Proxy Statement are made. Williams v. Air Lease Corp. Thomas v. Air Lease Corp. The Company has also received multiple demand letters from counsel representing purported Class A common stockholders of the Company since the filing of the Preliminary Proxy Statement on October 15, 2025. These demand letters allege that the Preliminary Proxy Statement or the Definitive Proxy Statement violates applicable federal or state law and contains materially misleading and/or incomplete disclosures concerning, among other things, the Company's financial projections, the analyses conducted by the Company's financial advisors, the personal or business relationships between the directors and executives of the Company and those of the Equity Investors and the prior representations by the Company's legal advisor of Brookfield. These demand letters request that the Company issue supplemental disclosures to the Definitive Proxy Statement. 2 While the Company believes that the disclosures in the Definitive Proxy Statement comply fully with all applicable laws, denies the allegations in the Complaints described above and believes they are without merit, in order to moot the allegations and any potential claims regarding disclosures, avoid nuisance and possible expense and business delays, and provide additional information to its Class A common stockholders, the Company has determined voluntarily to supplement certain disclosures in the Definitive Proxy Statement related to the Complaints' and the demand letters' allegations with the supplemental disclosures set forth below (the \"Supplemental Disclosures\"). Nothing in the Supplemental Disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal merit, necessity or materiality under applicable laws of any of the disclosures set forth herein. To the contrary, the Company specifically denies all allegations in the Complaints and the various demand letters that any additional disclosure was or is required or material.

Certain of these transactions may have characteristics that are materially different from those of the proposed merger. However, the selected transactions were chosen because certain aspects of the transactions, for purposes of J.P. Morgan's analysis, may be considered similar to the proposed merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the transactions differently than they would affect the proposed merger. Based on the results of this analysis , and after excluding the transactions for which the P/BV ratio was not available and taking into account such other factors J.P. Morgan considered appropriate, J.P. Morgan selected a P/BV reference range of 0.66x to 1.67x. J.P. Morgan then applied this reference range to the Company's BVPS of $65.96, as of June 30, 2025 calculated pro forma for publicly announced cash contingent and possessed insurance settlement proceeds to recover losses relating to aircraft detained in Russia. This resulted in implied equity value of $43.55 to $110.15 (in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05) per share of Class A Common Stock, compared to the merger consideration of $65.00 per share of Class A Common Stock. The subsection titled \"Dividend Discount Analysis\" starting on page 65 of the Definitive Proxy Statement is amended by replacing the subsection in its entirety with the following (new text is underlined and bold): Dividend Discount Analysis J.P. Morgan conducted a dividend discount analysis to determine a range of equity values for the Class A Common Stock based on 114.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding provided by the Company's management, assuming the Company continued to operate as a standalone entity. The range was determined by adding the present value of an estimated future dividend stream for the Company over an eight-year period from 2025 through 2032, using the Air Lease Projections (as defined below) provided by the management of the Company (as discussed more fully in the section entitled \" Certain Projected Financial Information \" beginning on page 69 of this proxy statement) and the present value of an estimated terminal value of the shares of Class A Common Stock at the end of 2032. J.P. Morgan used the perpetuity growth method to calculate the range of terminal values based on a terminal value growth rate of 1.50% to 2.50% (among other terminal year assumptions) . The range of terminal values was then discounted to present values as of June 30, 2025 using a range of discount rates from 8.50% to 9.50%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis J.P. Morgan ' s estimate of the cost of equity of the Company , taking into account macroeconomic assumptions, estimates of risk, the Company ' s capital structure and other factors that J.P. Morgan considered to be appropriate in its experience and professional judgment . This analysis implied an equity value of $58.30 to $75.20 (in each case, rounded to the nearest $0.05) per share of Class A Common Stock as of June 30, 2025, compared to the merger consideration of $65.00 per share of Class A Common Stock. The disclosure in the section titled \"The Merger Certain Projected Financial Information\" beginning on page 69 of the Definitive Proxy Statement, is hereby amended as follows: The Company, as a matter of course, does not publicly disclose long-term forecasts or internal projections as to future financial performance, earnings, or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the Air Lease Board's evaluation of the merger, the Company's management provided to J.P. Morgan and Parent certain unaudited prospective financial information relating to the Company on a standalone basis for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2025 through December 31, 2028, and extrapolations of certain forecasts for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2029 through December 31, 2032 (the \"Air Lease Projections\") , which we refer to as the Preliminary Projections (as defined below) and the Air Lease Projections (as defined below) . The Air Lease Projections were provided to J.P. Morgan by the Company for its use and reliance in connection with its financial analyses and opinion, as more fully described in the section entitled \" Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor\" beginning on page 60. 4 None of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the proposed merger.

The disclosure in the section titled \"The Merger Certain Projected Financial Information\" beginning on page 69 of the Definitive Proxy Statement, is hereby amended as follows: The Company, as a matter of course, does not publicly disclose long-term forecasts or internal projections as to future financial performance, earnings, or other results due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, in connection with the Air Lease Board's evaluation of the merger, the Company's management provided to J.P.

The Air Lease Projections were provided to J.P. Morgan by the Company for its use and reliance in connection with its financial analyses and opinion, as more fully described in the section entitled \" Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor\" beginning on page 60. (the \"Air Lease Projections\") , which we refer to as the Preliminary Projections (as defined below) and the Air Lease Projections (as defined below) Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor\" 4 The summary of the Preliminary Projections and the Air Lease Projections below is not included to influence the decision of Class A Common Stockholders whether to vote to approve the merger or any other proposal to be considered at the special meeting, but is provided solely because it was such summary projections were made available to the Air Lease Board and J.P. Morgan in connection with the merger. The inclusion of the below information should not be regarded as an indication that any of the Company or its respective advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, to be necessarily predictive of actual future results, or that it should be construed as financial guidance, and such summary projections set forth below should not be relied on as such. This information was prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many respects. While presented with numerical specificity, the Preliminary Projections and the Air Lease Projections reflect numerous estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of the Company's management, including, among others, the factors described in the sections entitled \" Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information \" and \" Where You Can Find Additional Information .\" The Preliminary Projections and the Air Lease Projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and subjective judgment that is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments.

As a condition to consummation of the Purchase, all of the then-existing members of the Board of Directors (the \"Prior Board\") and all then-existing officers of the Company resigned, and the New Sponsor designated (i) a new board of directors, which was elected immediately prior to the closing of the Purchase by the Prior Sponsor as the then-sole holder of the Class B Ordinary Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company's amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, and (ii) a new management team, which was appointed immediately prior to the closing of the Purchase by the Prior Board, effective as of the closing of the Purchase. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the New Sponsor agreed, among other things, to (i) deliver executed consents to act as directors and officers for the incoming directors and officers, (ii) execute a joinder agreement (the \"Joinder\") to become a party to the Registration Rights Agreement, dated June 9, 2025 (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\"), among the Company, the Prior Sponsor, the underwriter of the Company's initial public offering, BTIG, LLC (the \"Underwriter\"), and the other parties thereto and (iii) enter into a side letter agreement with the Company (the \"Insider Letter\") providing for, among other things, voting obligations and certain transfer restrictions. The Prior Sponsor and the Company, among other things, agreed to (i) deliver resignation letters from all outgoing directors and officers, and (ii) cause all parties to the Letter Agreement dated June 9, 2025, by and among the Company, the Prior Sponsor and each of the directors and officers of the Company (the \"Prior Insider Letter\"), to execute a waiver to certain requirements of the Prior Insider Letter such that the New Sponsor need not execute a joinder or become a party to the Prior Insider Letter.

The conditions to the closing of the Purchase were satisfied. The Purchase Agreement contained customary representations and warranties of the parties, including, among others, with respect to corporate authority. The Purchase Agreement also included indemnification provisions pursuant to which the Prior Sponsor has agreed to indemnify the New Sponsor and the Company for certain losses, damages, liabilities, and claims, including those arising from breaches of representations and warranties, claims by third parties, or any failure to deliver the acquired securities free and clear of liens or other encumbrances. The representations and warranties of each party set forth in the Purchase Agreement were made solely for the benefit of the other parties to the Purchase Agreement, and shareholders of the Company are not third-party beneficiaries of the Purchase Agreement.

(NASDAQ:PROF; TSX:PRN) (\"Profound\" or the \"Company\"), a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and markets AI-powered, MRI-guided, incision-free therapies for the ablation of diseased tissue, announced today the upcoming launch of its TULSA-AI Volume Reduction module for optimizing the treatment of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (\"BPH\"), or enlarged prostate, at the Radiological Society of North America (\"RSNA\") meeting taking place in Chicago, Nov. 30-Dec. 4. BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland due to an overgrowth of prostate cells. It is a common condition as men age, often impeding the flow of urine and creating significant lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Current BPH treatment with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is largely unchanged over the past 100 years. Many alternative treatment methods have been investigated aiming to improve the patient experience and reduce the rates of complications such as bleeding, erectile dysfunction, loss of ejaculation, and the need to stay in the hospital overnight for one, two or more days. The TULSA ProcedureTM, performed using Profound's TULSA-PRO system, is the only incision-free procedure for prostate cancer, BPH, and patients who have both prostate cancer and BPH. With the TULSA-AI Volume Reduction module, physicians can efficiently and easily stack multiple prostate cases in one day, using the same device hardware, clinical support staff and reimbursement codes. The TULSA Procedure's clinical flexibility - along with real-world data demonstrating significantly reduced risk of loss of sexual function and incontinence, and CAPTAIN perioperative data demonstrating the TULSA Procedure's superiority to Robotic Prostatectomy in blood loss, length of stay, post-op pain and recovery time - is fueling strong demand for the incision-free procedure from both patients and healthcare providers. \"We're confident to launch the TULSA-AI Volume Reduction module for BPH, following a successful pilot trial earlier this year,\" said Profound CEO and Chairman, Arun Menawat. \"The use of AI to streamline the workflow and reduce procedure times is a significant advance that makes using TULSA-PRO for treating enlarged prostate just as efficient as other modern procedures, but with the advanced benefits of precision and customization to any prostate shape or size. We expect the reduced procedure times will increase adoption of the TULSA Procedure and triple Profound's total available market in prostate disease to about 600,000 patients annually.\" The Company will also present new data on TULSA-PRO for prostate cancer at both RSNA and the Society for Urologic Oncology (\"SUO\") in Pheonix, Dec. 2-5. RSNA EVENT DETAILS RSNA attendees can find Profound at Booth #3153, South Hall A, for demonstrations of the newly launched TULSA-AI Volume Reduction module, along with case studies and feature upgrades from the pilot launch.

About Profound Medical Corp. Profound is a commercial-stage medical device company that develops and markets AI-powered, MRI-guided, incision-free therapies for the ablation of diseased tissue. Profound is commercializing TULSA-PRO, a technology that combines real-time MRI, AI-enhanced planning, robotically-driven transurethral ultrasound and closed-loop temperature feedback control. The TULSA ProcedureTM , performed using the TULSA-PRO system, has the potential of becoming a mainstream treatment modality across the entire prostate disease spectrum; ranging from low-, intermediate-, or high-risk prostate cancer; to hybrid patients suffering from both prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (\"BPH\"); to men with BPH only; and also, to patients requiring salvage therapy for radio-recurrent localized prostate cancer. The TULSA Procedure employs real-time MR guidance for precision to preserve patients' urinary continence and sexual function, while killing the targeted prostate tissue via precise sound absorption technology that gently heats it to 55-57C. TULSA is an incision- and radiation-free \"one-and-done\" procedure performed in a single session that takes a few hours. Virtually all prostate shapes and sizes can be safely, effectively, and efficiently treated with TULSA. There is no bleeding associated with the procedure; no hospital stay is required; and most TULSA patients report quick recovery to their normal routine. TULSA-PRO is CE marked, Health Canada approved, and 510(k) cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\").

Pursuant to such authority granted by the Company's stockholders, the Company's board of directors approved a one-for-twenty-five (1:25) reverse stock split (the \"Reverse Stock Split\") of the Company's common stock and the filing of the Amendment to effectuate the Reverse Stock Split. The Amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Reverse Stock Split will become effective in accordance with the terms of the Amendment at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on December 1, 2025 (the \"Effective Time\"), and the Company's common stock will open for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on December 1, 2025 on a post-split basis, under the existing ticker symbol \"MBRX\" but with a new CUSIP number 60855D408. The Amendment provides that, at the Effective Time, every twenty-five (25) shares of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock will automatically be combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in par value per share, which will remain $0.001. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of shares of common stock outstanding will be reduced from approximately 51.6 million shares to approximately 2.07 million shares, and the number of authorized shares of common stock will remain at 500 million shares. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, except as set forth below, proportionate adjustments will be made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all outstanding stock options, restricted stock unit awards and warrants, which will result in a proportional decrease in the number of shares of the Company's common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options, restricted stock unit awards and warrants, and, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportional increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and warrants. With respect to the Company's outstanding Series E Warrants to purchase 27,852,241 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.37 per share and Series F warrants to purchase 64,864,864 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.43 per share, if the lowest daily volume weighted average price during the period commencing five consecutive trading days immediately preceding and the five consecutive trading days commencing on the date of the Reverse Stock Split is less than the exercise price of the Series E warrants and/or Series F warrants then in effect, then the exercise price of such warrants will be reduced to the lowest daily volume weighted average price during such period. In addition, solely with respect to the Series E warrants, the number of shares issuable upon exercise will be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate price will remain unchanged, subject to a floor price of $3.00 per share. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Company's equity compensation plan immediately prior to the Effective Time will be reduced proportionately. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, and instead, the Company will pay cash (without interest) equal to such fraction multiplied by the average of the closing sales prices of the common stock during the regular trading hours for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Reverse Stock Split. The share amounts set forth in the above paragraph do not take into account any shares which may be paid for in connection with the foregoing treatment of fractional shares.

The reverse stock split will take effect at 12:01 am (Eastern Time) on December 1, 2025, and the Company's common stock will open for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on December 1, 2025 on a post-split basis, under the existing ticker symbol \"MBRX\" but with a new CUSIP number 60855D 408. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 25 shares of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding prior to the opening of trading on December 1, 2025 will be consolidated into one issued and outstanding share, with no change in the nominal par value per share of $0.001. No fractional shares will be issued if, as a result of the reverse stock split, a stockholder would become entitled to a fractional share because the number of shares of common stock they hold before the reverse stock split is not evenly divisible by the split ratio. Instead, the stockholder will be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu of a fractional share. As a result of the reverse stock split, the number of shares of common stock outstanding will be reduced from approximately 51.7 million shares to approximately 2.1 million shares, and the number of authorized shares of common stock will remain at 500 million shares. About Moleculin Biotech, Inc. Moleculin Biotech, Inc. is a Phase 3 clinical stage pharmaceutical company advancing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates addressing hard-to-treat tumors and viruses. The Company's lead program, Annamycin, is a next-generation highly efficacious and well tolerated anthracycline designed to avoid multidrug resistance mechanisms and to lack the cardiotoxicity common with currently prescribed anthracyclines. Annamycin is currently in development for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) lung metastases. The Company has begun the MIRACLE ( olecul /R AML nnAraC inical valuation) Trial (MB-108), a pivotal, adaptive design Phase 3 trial evaluating Annamycin in combination with cytarabine, together referred to as AnnAraC (the combination of Annamycin and cytarabine, also referred to as \"Ara-C\") and, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Following a successful Phase 1B/2 study (MB-106), with input from the FDA, the Company believes it has substantially de-risked the development pathway towards a potential approval for Annamycin for the treatment of AML. This study remains subject to appropriate future filings with potential additional feedback from the FDA and their foreign equivalents. Additionally, the Company is developing WP1066, an Immune/Transcription Modulator capable of inhibiting p-STAT3 and other oncogenic transcription factors while also stimulating a natural immune response, targeting brain tumors, pancreatic and other cancers. Moleculin also has in its pipeline a portfolio of antimetabolites, including WP1122 for the potential treatment of pathogenic viruses, as well as certain cancer indications.

Larson's departure is not the result of any disagreements with the Company on any matter relating to its financial statements, internal control over financial reporting, operations, policies or practices. About Beyond Air , Inc. Beyond Air is a commercial-stage medical device and biopharmaceutical company dedicated to harnessing the power of endogenous and exogenous nitric oxide (NO) to improve the lives of patients suffering from respiratory illnesses, neurological disorders, and solid tumors. The Company has received FDA approval and CE Mark for its first system, LungFit PH, for the treatment of term and near-term neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure. Beyond Air is currently advancing its other revolutionary LungFit systems in clinical trials for the treatment of severe lung infections such as viral community-acquired pneumonia (including COVID-19) and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Company has also partnered with The Hebrew University of Jerusalem to advance a pre-clinical program dedicated to the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurological disorders. Additionally, Beyond Cancer, Ltd., an affiliate of Beyond Air, is investigating ultra-high concentrations of NO with a proprietary delivery system to target certain solid tumors in the pre-clinical setting. For more information, visit www.beyondair.net About LungFit * Beyond Air's LungFit is a cylinder-free, phasic flow generator and delivery system designated as a medical device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The ventilator-compatible version of the device can generate NO from ambient air on demand for delivery to the lungs at concentrations ranging from 1 ppm to 80 ppm. The LungFit system could potentially replace large, high-pressure NO cylinders, providing significant advantages in the hospital setting, including greatly reducing inventory and storage requirements, improving overall safety by eliminating NO2 purging steps, and offering other operational benefits. LungFit can also deliver NO at concentrations at or above 80 ppm for potentially treating severe acute lung infections in the hospital setting (e.g., COVID-19, bronchiolitis) and chronic, refractory lung infections in the home setting (e.g., NTM). With the elimination of cylinders, Beyond Air intends to offer NO treatment in the home setting. *Beyond Air's LungFit PH is approved for commercial use in the United States, European Union, and many other countries around the world. Beyond Air's other LungFit systems are not approved for commercial use and are for investigational use only. Beyond Air is not suggesting NO use over 80 ppm or use at home. About Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a lethal condition and secondary to failure of normal circulatory transition at birth. It is a syndrome characterized by elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that causes labile hypoxemia due to decreased pulmonary blood flow and right-to-left shunting of blood. Its incidence has been reported as 1.9 per 1,000 live births (0.46.8/1000 live births) with mortality rate ranging between 433%. This syndrome complicates the course of about 10% of infants with respiratory failure and remains a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. NO gas is a vasodilator, is approved in dozens of countries to improve oxygenation and reduces the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in term and near-term (>34 weeks gestation) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension in conjunction with ventilator support and other appropriate agents. About Beyond Cancer, Ltd. Beyond Cancer, Ltd., an affiliate of Beyond Air, Inc., is a development-stage biopharmaceutical and medical device company utilizing (UNO via a proprietary delivery platform to treat primary tumors and prevent metastatic disease. Nitric oxide at ultra-high concentrations has been reported to show anticancer properties and to potentially serve as a chemosensitizer and radiotherapy enhancer. A first-in-human study is underway in subjects with solid tumors. The Company is conducting preclinical studies of UNO in multiple solid tumor models to inform additional treatment protocols. For more information, visit www.beyondcancer.com About NeuroNOS NeuroNOS is at the forefront of developing innovative treatments for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The company specializes in creating therapies based on small molecules that cross the blood-brain barrier to regulate Nitric Oxide (NO) levels in the brain. Preclinical studies conducted by NeuroNOS have demonstrated that NO is present at elevated levels in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and adults suffering from brain-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and brain cancers. The company's research has shown that managing NO levels in the brain is crucial for maintaining normal brain function. By leveraging this groundbreaking science, NeuroNOS aims to bring transformative therapies to those affected by these challenging conditions, ultimately improving individuals' lives.

However, pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, in no event will the Company sell the Shares in a public primary offering with a value exceeding more than one-third (1/3) of the aggregate market value of the Company's common stock held by non-affiliates in any twelve (12)-month period, so long as the aggregate market value of the Company's outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates remains below $75,000,000. Sales of the Shares, if any, will be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an \"at the market\" offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Act\"), which includes sales made directly on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and such other sales as agreed upon by the Company and the Agent. Any Shares sold will be issued pursuant to a prospectus dated September 9, 2024, and a prospectus supplement dated November 21, 2025, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), in connection with one or more offerings of Shares under the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-281578) originally filed with the SEC on August 23, 2024, and declared effective by the SEC on September 9, 2024. The Company has agreed to pay the Agent a commission of 3% of the gross sales price of any Shares sold in the offering. The Company may sell the Shares in amounts and at times to be determined by the Company from time to time subject to the terms and conditions of the ATM Agreement, but is not obligated to sell, and the Agent is not obligated to buy or sell, any Shares under the ATM Agreement. No assurance can be given that the Company will sell any Shares under the ATM Agreement, or, if it does, as to the price or amount of Shares that it sells or the dates when such sales will take place. The offering of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the sale of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement having an aggregate sales price of $10,000,000, (2) the termination by the Company or the Agent of the ATM Agreement pursuant to its terms, and (3) November 21, 2026. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Company has sold 10,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement. The Company may sell the Shares in amounts and at times to be determined by the Company from time to time subject to the terms and conditions of the ATM Agreement, but is not obligated to sell, and the Agent is not obligated to buy or sell, any Shares under the ATM Agreement. No assurance can be given that the Company will sell any Shares under the ATM Agreement, or, if it does, as to the price or amount of Shares that it sells or the dates when such sales will take place.

On November 28, 2025, Flora Growth Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of the Province of Ontario (the \"Company\", \"our\"), entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") and a Registration Rights Agreement (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\") with White Lion Capital, LLC (the \"Investor\"), pursuant to which the Investor has committed to purchase, subject to certain limitations, up to $25 million (the \"Initial Commitment\") of the Company's common shares, no par value (the \"Common Shares\"), which Initial Commitment may be increased to up to an aggregate of $50 million Common Shares at the discretion of the Company upon a written notice to the Investor (the \"Total Commitment\"). Under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to direct the Investor to purchase up to the Total Commitment of Common Shares from time to time for a period of 24 months from the date of the Purchase Agreement. The purchase is subject to certain conditions, including the filing and effectiveness of a resale registration statement (the \"Registration Statement\") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") registering the resale of the shares to be sold to the Investor under the Purchase Agreement. Upon receipt of a purchase notice from the Company, the Investor may be obligated to purchase Common Shares as the Company directs, subject to certain conditions and limitations. The Company can provide two kinds of notices - a regular purchase notice and a rapid purchase notice. The Common Shares will be purchased by the Investor according to the kind of notice provided. For: a regular purchase notice, 97% of the lowest daily VWAP of the Common Shares for the two consecutive business days commencing on and including the day the regular purchase notice is delivered; or a rapid purchase notice, either (i) the lowest traded price of the Common Shares on the date the rapid purchase notice is delivered or (ii) 97% of the lowest traded price of the Shares two hours following the written confirmation of the acceptance of the rapid purchase notice by the Investor. As such, the actual number of Common Shares purchased by the Investor under the Purchase Agreement will vary depending on the then-current market price of our Common Shares sold to the Investor under the Purchase Agreement, but will not exceed the number set forth above unless we file an additional registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), with the SEC. Actual sales of Common Shares, if any, to the Investor will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time-to-time, including, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of the Company's Common Shares, and determinations by the Company as to the appropriate sources of funding for the Company and its operations. The net proceeds from sales, if any, under the Purchase Agreement to the Company will depend on the frequency and prices at which the Company sells Common Shares to the Investor. The Company expects that any proceeds received by the Company from such sales to the Investor will primarily be used to advance the Company's digital asset treasury strategy with a focus on the $0G token and for general corporate purposes. It is possible that no shares will be issued under the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company will pay commitment fee to the Investor in the form of Common Shares with an aggregate market value of $125,000 or 0.5% of the Initial Commitment (the \"Initial Commitment Fee\"), which will be paid on the effective date of the Registration Statement (each a \"Commitment Fee Payment Date\"). If the Initial Commitment is increased, the Company will pay an additional commitment fee to the Investor in the form of Common Shares with an aggregate market value equal to 0.5% of such increased commitment amount. In connection with the entry into the Purchase Agreement, the Company also entered into the Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to file with the SEC, within twenty business days of the execution date of the Purchase Agreement, the Registration Statement for the resale by the Investor of the Common Shares that may be issued in connection with the Initial Commitment under the Purchase Agreement (including the Common Shares used to pay the Initial Commitment Fee, if any). The Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, conditions, and indemnification obligations of the parties. The Purchase Agreement will automatically terminate on the earlier of (i) the end of the commitment period (which shall mean the period commencing on the execution date of the Purchase Agreement and ending on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Investor shall have purchased an aggregate number of Common Shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement equal to the commitment amount or (ii) twenty four (24) months following the execution date of the Purchase Agreement (the \"Commitment Period\") or (ii) the date that, pursuant to or within the meaning of any bankruptcy law codified as Title 11, U.S. Code, or any similar federal or state law for the relief of debtors, the Company commences a voluntary case or any person commences a proceeding against the Company, a custodian is appointed for the Company or for all or substantially all of its property or the Company makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors.

(\"Stran\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: SWAG) (NASDAQ: SWAGW), a leading outsourced marketing solutions provider that leverages its promotional products and loyalty incentive expertise, is pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has appointed Jack Audibert to Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO). Mr. Audibert had previously served as Vice President of Growth and Strategic Initiatives since joining the Company in 2020. This expanded role aligns the Company's leadership structure with its growth priorities and evolving operational needs. \"Jack has been an invaluable member of our senior management team for many years,\" said Andy Shape, Chief Executive Officer of Stran. \"His leadership has supported the Company through multiple phases of expansion, from our earlier development efforts through to our IPO and subsequent growth as a public company. He has played a central role in both our organic initiatives and our M&A strategy, including the acquisition and integration of six companies. His strategic discipline, operational insight, and deep understanding of our business have been instrumental in advancing our long-term objectives, and we look forward to his continued contributions as we work to further strengthen our leadership position in the multi-billion-dollar promotional products industry.\" \"I'm honored by the confidence the Board and Andy have placed in me,\" said Mr. Audibert. \"Stran has entered an exciting phase of growth, and I'm committed to helping drive disciplined execution across our strategic initiatives, integrations, and expanding operational footprint. We have a tremendous opportunity to build on our heritage, strengthen our leadership position in the industry, and continue delivering value for our customers, partners, and shareholders.\" Mr. Audibert's expanded responsibilities formalize oversight areas he has long influenced across the organization while positioning him to play an even greater role in shaping the Company's future. As CSO, he will continue to lead Stran's corporate planning, evaluate and advance new growth opportunities, and guide the strategic framework supporting the Company's next phase of expansion. As CCO, he will oversee Stran's regulatory and compliance functions, which are increasingly critical given the expanding operational footprint of the Company's Stran Loyalty Solutions segment. Following the Gander Group acquisition, casino-related licensing, regulatory obligations, and compliance requirements demand heightened structure and coordination.

Renergen and ASPI remain fully committed to the Scheme and are making progress in fulfilling the final outstanding Conditions. As previously announced, key milestone transaction approvals have already been received, including the approval from the Competition Commission, which has paved the way for the two companies to plan integration processes and begin collaborating. In this regard, Shareholders are advised that the written consent to the transfer of Renergen Shares in terms of the Offer has been obtained from the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa and the United States International Development Finance Corporation and accordingly that the relevant Offer Condition set out in paragraph 5.2.1.1 of the Circular has now been fulfilled. As mentioned in the joint announcement dated 15 September 2025, it is not unusual for the fulfilment of conditions for a transaction of this nature to require additional time when regulatory or 3 party approvals are required, as these are out of the control of both ASPI and Renergen. The parties remain confident that the remaining Conditions will be fulfilled (or, where applicable, waived) in due course and therefore the parties have agreed to extend the deadline for the fulfilment of remaining Conditions proactively to 30 January 2026 , in accordance with paragraph 5.2.5 of the Circular. Both Renergen and ASPI remain fully engaged in working together to obtain the required approvals as quickly as possible. Once the remaining Conditions have been fulfilled (or if applicable waived), Renergen and ASPI will announce the updated salient dates and times for the Scheme on SENS and on the ASX. With reference to the ASPI Funding Arrangements, it is confirmed that the date for Renergen's repayment of the funding advanced to it, has been extended by agreement between the parties, in terms of the Loan Agreement, to 30 January 2026.

(the \"Company\"), upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the \"Committee\"), granted a one-time, premium-priced performance-based option award to Henry Schuck, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company (the \"CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option\") under the Company's 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option reflects the culmination of a multi-month process overseen by the Committee, with the assistance of the Committee's independent compensation consultant and outside legal advisors, to design a program that would serve as a significant incentive and retentive vehicle at a strategic inflection point for the Company. The CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option is designed to tightly align Mr. Schuck's long-term compensation with sustained stockholder value creation. The CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option directly links potential realizable value to the achievement of ambitious, measurable outcomes over a ten-year period. Specifically, it (i) focuses Mr. Schuck on durable, compounding free cash flow per share growth as the foundation of value creation, (ii) rewards sustained stock performance through a 20 consecutive trading-day average closing price requirement, designed to help ensure that vesting is based on lasting results, rather than short-term volatility, (iii) requires outperformance relative to the broader market to reinforce accountability to investors and (iv) serves both as a long-term retention vehicle and a public signal of the Board's confidence in Mr. Schuck and the strategy set by him, the Company's operational execution and the Company's future stock price appreciation. The Committee determined that now is the appropriate time to issue the CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option to Mr. Schuck, given the Company's strategic inflection point. The CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option is intended to reinforce continuity of leadership during a period of transformation toward more durable, up-market growth with industry-leading and AI-centered products and to align Mr. Schuck's incentives squarely with the next phase of the Company's long-term value creation. The description of the CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option is qualified in its entirety by reference to the award agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Subject to the satisfaction of rigorous performance goals relating to the Company's stock price and free cash flow performance and Mr. Schuck's continued service as the Company's Chief Executive Officer or Executive Chairman, the CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option provides Mr. Schuck with the opportunity to purchase up to 9,678,000 shares of the Company's common stock, at an exercise price equal to $13.54, representing a premium price that is 140% of the fair market value of the price per share as of the Grant Date. To incentivize performance, the entire CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option is \"at-risk,\" with no portion of the award eligible for vesting unless these rigorous performance goals are satisfied. In addition, to further support alignment with stockholder interests, the award: supports the retention of Mr. Schuck by including a service-based vesting condition, which lapses in one-third annual installments on each of the three-year, four-year and five-year anniversaries of the Grant Date (each, a \"Vesting Date\"), subject to Mr. Schuck's continued service as Chief Executive Officer or Executive Chairman; supports the retention of Mr. Schuck by including a service-based vesting condition, which lapses in one-third annual installments on each of the three-year, four-year and five-year anniversaries of the Grant Date (each, a \"Vesting Date\"), subject to Mr. Schuck's continued service as Chief Executive Officer or Executive Chairman; vests based on both the Company's absolute and relative performance; vests based on both the Company's absolute and relative performance; does not provide for vesting in the event of a termination of employment unless the underlying performance goals are achieved prior to or during a limited period following a termination due to death, disability, by the Company without cause or by Mr. Schuck for good reason; does not provide for vesting in the event of a termination of employment unless the underlying performance goals are achieved prior to or during a limited period following a termination due to death, disability, by the Company without cause or by Mr. Schuck for good reason; in the event of a change in control, the award will only vest to the extent the underlying stock price goal is achieved in connection with such transaction, and the award will remain subject to the service-based vesting conditions, subject to accelerated vesting in the event of a qualifying termination of employment; and in the event of a change in control, the award will only vest to the extent the underlying stock price goal is achieved in connection with such transaction, and the award will remain subject to the service-based vesting conditions, subject to accelerated vesting in the event of a qualifying termination of employment; and includes non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenants. includes non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenants. Importantly, the Company does not intend to grant any other equity awards to Mr. Schuck during the 10-year term of the award and, thus, the CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option represents an up-front equity award in lieu of annual participation in the Company's long-term incentive program. Performance Goals The Committee selected adjusted free cash flow per share as the primary long-term performance measure because the Committee believes it most directly reflects the Company's ability to create sustained stockholder value, while maintaining operational discipline. Adjusted free cash flow per share integrates revenue growth, profitability, capital efficiency, and share count management into a single metric that the Company believes aligns with how investors evaluate the Company's long-term performance and intrinsic value creation. In addition, the Committee determined that stock price performance, measured based on the Company's average closing price over 20 consecutive trading days, is an essential complement to the internal operational metric of adjusted free cash flow per share. The inclusion of stock price directly aligns Mr. Schuck's potential realizable value with long-term stockholder returns, which the Company believes provides a transparent, market-based measure of performance that investors can independently verify. Subject to the service-based vesting condition described above, the CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option will vest based on the Company's adjusted free cash flow per share and stock price performance over 12-month periods ending on the last day of each of the eight fiscal quarters of the Company during 24-month measurement periods (the \"Performance Measurement Period\"), starting with the fiscal quarter of the Company ending on or immediately following the one-year anniversary of the Grant Date and ending with the last fiscal quarter ending prior to the 10-year expiration date of the award. Under the terms of the CEO Premium-Priced Performance Option, the award is divided into six equal tranches, with each tranche subject to a stock price goal (based on average closing stock price over a 20 consecutive trading day period) and adjusted free cash flow per share goal as follows: Tranche Stock Price Goal Stock Price Goal Increase from Per Share Fair Market Value as of the Grant Date Adjusted Free Cash Flow per Share Goal 1 $40.00 414% $2.5 2 $60.00 620% $3 3 $70.00 724% $3.5 4 $80.00 827% $4 5 $90.00 931% $4.5 6 $100.00 1,034% $5 Tranche Stock Price Goal Stock Price Goal Increase from Per Share Fair Market Value as of the Grant Date Adjusted Free Cash Flow per Share Goal Tranche Stock Price Goal Stock Price Goal Increase from Per Share Fair Market Value as of the Grant Date Adjusted Free Cash Flow per Share Goal 1 $40.00 414% $2.5 1 $40.00 414% $2.5 2 $60.00 620% $3 2 $60.00 620% $3 3 $70.00 724% $3.5 3 $70.00 724% $3.5 4 $80.00 827% $4 4 $80.00 827% $4 5 $90.00 931% $4.5 5 $90.00 931% $4.5 6 $100.00 1,034% $5 6 $100.00 1,034% $5 To vest, both the stock price goal and the adjusted free cash flow goal must be achieved during the Performance Measurement Period. In addition, to ensure that the stock price goal is not achieved merely because the Company's stock price appreciates due to broad market inflation, the stock price goal will only be satisfied if the Company's TSR performance for the applicable 12-month period is at or above the 25th percentile of all companies in the Russell 3000 Index as of the Grant Date. If the performance goals with respect to a tranche are satisfied prior to the applicable Vesting Date, such tranche will remain outstanding and will vest on the applicable Vesting Date, subject to Mr. Schuck's continued service through such date. In the event of a change in control of the Company, performance will be measured at the time of the change in control based only on whether the transaction price per share in the change in control equals or exceeds the stock price goals, and the award will remain subject to the service-based vesting condition through the applicable Vesting Date, subject to accelerated vesting in the event of a qualifying termination in connection with such change in control. In addition, in the event Mr. Schuck's employment is terminated by the Company without cause, due to Mr. Schuck's death or disability or is terminated by Mr. Schuck for good reason, the award will remain outstanding for up to two years following such termination, and will vest to the extent the underlying performance goals are achieved during such two year period, with pro-rata vesting if the termination occurs prior to the last Vesting Date and no vesting if the termination occurs prior to the third anniversary of the Grant Date and the achievement of the performance goals.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score": 0.996573805809021}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9988020658493042}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.987728476524353}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995352029800415}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.936369776725769}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9241747856140137}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9954147338867188}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9980680346488953}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9990525841712952}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.7253220081329346}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9988458156585693}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994219541549683}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993675351142883}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995618462562561}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9996011853218079}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.963792622089386}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995792508125305}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9992234706878662}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9989532232284546}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9994500279426575}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9995489716529846}, {"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993966817855835}], "sentiment": "neutral"}, "item 9.01": {"text": "The following Exhibit 10.1 is furnished pursuant to Item 5.02 of this Current Report.

Sponsor Equity Agreement In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Apeiron Investment Group Limited (\"Apeiron\") and A SPAC IV (Holdings) Corp. (the \"Sponsor\") entered into a sponsor equity agreement (the \"Sponsor Equity Agreement\"), dated as of November 26, 2025. Pursuant to the Sponsor Equity Agreement, subject to the closing of the Business Combination, (i) Apeiron granted the Sponsor an option to require Apeiron to purchase up to 100%, and the Sponsor granted Apeiron an option to purchase, up to 100%, but no less than 78%, of the equity securities then held by the Sponsor in the surviving company (the \"Sponsor Securities\"), in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth therein, (ii) Apeiron paid the Sponsor a deposit of $5,500,000, which is generally non-refundable, subject to certain exceptions, and (iii) the parties agreed to certain termination fee arrangements as described below. 4 Under the terms of the Sponsor Equity Agreement, following the closing of the Business Combination, and during the 90-day period thereafter, the Sponsor will have the right to sell (the \"Put Option\") to Apeiron up to 100%, and Apeiron will have the right to require the Sponsor to sell (the \"Call Option\") to Apeiron, up to 100% (and not less than 78%) of the Sponsor Securities, free and clear of liens (other than certain customary restrictions). The purchase price for the Sponsor Securities pursuant to the Put Option or Call Option will be determined based on the percentage of Sponsor Securities delivered, as set forth in the Sponsor Equity Agreement, less the deposit amount previously paid by Apeiron. The maximum purchase price for the Put Option and Call Option are in a range of $6,700,000 to $9,000,000 and in a range of $11,000,000 to $15,500,000, respectively, in each case depending on the number of shares received and, furthermore, in each case less the deposit previously paid by Apeiron. The Put Option and Call Option may only be exercised during the specified option period and are subject to certain procedural and closing conditions set forth in the Sponsor Equity Agreement. Additionally, the Sponsor Equity Agreement provides for the payment by the Sponsor to Apeiron of a termination fee of up to $4,875,000 under certain circumstances if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated due to a willful breach by A Paradise or its affiliates, including the Sponsor. The amount of the termination fee is subject to specific milestones relating to the preparation and filing of the proxy statement/registration statement for the Business Combination. The Sponsor Equity Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, including a lock-up on the transfer of Sponsor Securities during the option period, covenants relating to regulatory approvals and cooperation, and other customary provisions. A copy of the Sponsor Equity Agreement is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.3, and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the Sponsor Equity Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. Additional Agreements Executed Before Signing Simple Agreements for Future Equity Immediately prior to execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Enhanced entered into simple agreements for future equity (each, a \"SAFE\") with certain investors (each, a \"SAFE investor\") pursuant to an equity private placement that contemplates that, upon consummation of the Business Combination, all outstanding SAFEs issued by Enhanced will automatically convert, immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, into Enhanced Group Class A common stock in accordance with their terms. The number of shares of Enhanced Group Class A common stock to be issued upon conversion will be determined by dividing each SAFE investor's purchase amount by Enhanced's pre-money valuation cap of $1.2 billion, multiplied by the fully diluted capitalization of Enhanced immediately prior to the Business Combination. As a result, the SAFE holders will collectively receive a number of shares of Enhanced Group Class A common stock representing their pro rata ownership percentage in Enhanced Group on a fully diluted basis. Concurrently with such conversion, Enhanced Group will also issue to the SAFE investors warrants equal to fifty percent (50%) of the number of shares of Enhanced Group Class A common stock received upon conversion, each exercisable for one share of Class A common stock at a per-share price equal to the conversion price determined under the SAFE. Such warrants will have a two-year exercise period. In addition, the SAFE documents provide for a partial early release from a lock-up applicable to Enhanced securityholders upon completion of the Business Combination, as a result of which many SAFE investors are existing Enhanced shareholders, and therefore should not be seen as a third party validation of the valuation of the Business Combination. Additional Agreement to be Executed at Closing The Business Combination Agreement provides that, upon consummation of the transactions, the parties will enter into the following additional agreement, among others. Registration Rights Agreement At the closing, Enhanced Group, certain Enhanced Stockholders, Cohen and Company Capital Markets, a division of Cohen & Company Securities, LLC, and Sponsor will enter into a registration rights agreement (the \"Registration Rights Agreement\"). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, Enhanced Group will be required to register for resale securities held by the stockholders party thereto. Enhanced Group will have no obligation to facilitate or participate in more than two underwritten offerings in any twelve-month period. In addition, the holders have certain customary \"piggyback\" registration rights with respect to registrations initiated by Enhanced Group. Enhanced Group will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any registration statements pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. A copy of the form of Registration Rights Agreement is filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit C to the Business Combination Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1. 5 Important Information for Investors and Shareholders This Current Report relates to a proposed transaction involving A Paradise and Enhanced.

Such interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The Company's board of directors (\"Board\") was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Agreement approving the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Acquisition, and in making their recommendation that TZUP stockholders approve and adopt the Agreement. This supplement to the Interests of TZUP Executive Officers and Directors in the Acquisition (i) modifies the previously reported interests in the Acquisition with respect to the Company's officers and/or directors, Robert Haag, Isaac Dietrich, Joanna Massey, and Paul Dickman and (ii) describes additional interests in the Acquisition with respect to Christopher Ensey, who was appointed as a member of the Board effective as of October 14, 2025, to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Robert Haag. modifies the previously reported interests in the Acquisition with respect to the Company's officers and/or directors, Robert Haag, Isaac Dietrich, Joanna Massey, and Paul Dickman and (ii) as a member of the Board effective as of October 14, 2025, to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Robert Haag.

Members of the Board: Reference is made to our opinion dated October 3, 2025 (the \"Opinion\") delivered to the Board of Directors of Thumzup Media Corporation (\"Thumzup\" or the \"Company\") in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated August 18, 2025 (the \"Merger Agreement\") among the Company, Dogehash Technologies, Inc. (\"Dogehash\") and TZUP Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (\"Merger Sub\").\" Pursuant to the Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement), Merger Sub will be merged with and into Dogehash, with Dogehash continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the shareholders of Dogehash will receive an aggregate of 30,700,000 restricted shares of Thumzup common stock (the \"Merger Consideration\") in exchange for all of the outstanding equity of Dogehash. In the Opinion, and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, we stated that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to such matters, the Merger Consideration to be issued by Thumzup pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Thumzup common stock (other than Dogehash and its affiliates), in their capacity as such holders. We have been advised that the Merger Agreement has been or will be amended such that (i) certain outstanding indebtedness of Dogehash that was previously expected to be satisfied through the issuance of a portion of the Merger Consideration will instead have its principal amount repaid in cash at closing, (ii) only the accrued and unpaid interest on such indebtedness will be paid in shares of Thumzup common stock, and (iii) as a result, the aggregate number of restricted shares of Thumzup common stock to be issued as Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger will be reduced from 30,700,000 restricted shares to 30,075,000 restricted shares (the \"Revised Merger Consideration\"). At the request of the Board, we have considered the effect of the Revised Merger Consideration on the Opinion. In doing so, we have, among other things, reviewed information you have provided to us regarding the changes to the form and amount of the Merger Consideration described above.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and to the other assumptions, qualifications, limitations and matters set forth in the Opinion, and in light of the Revised Merger Consideration, we confirm that the changes to the form and amount of the Merger Consideration described above would not have altered the conclusion stated in our Opinion. Specifically, if we were required to render the Opinion again as of October 3, 2025, taking into account the Revised Merger Consideration, we would reach the same conclusion as set forth in the Opinion; namely, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the matters described therein, the Merger Consideration to be issued by Thumzup in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Thumzup common stock (other than Dogehash and its affiliates), in their capacity as such holders.

In the Notice, the Staff explained that it based this belief on its review of the Company's public disclosures and materials submitted to the Staff by the Company. In addition, the Staff noted its belief is supported by the Company's lack of revenue generating assets and the substantial reduction in employees and operations since February 2024. The Staff also considered the Company's quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q filed on May 8, 2025, August 7, 2025, and November 13, 2025, respectively, which indicated that the Company has not generated any revenue for the nine months ended 2025 and that the Company had research and development expenses of only $16,000. The Notice further advised that, unless the Company timely requests a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the \"Panel\"), it would be subject to suspension/delisting. The Company disagrees with the Staff's view regarding the Company's status as a \"public shell\" and, accordingly, intends to timely request a hearing. The hearing request will automatically stay any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period that may be granted by the Panel following the hearing.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Impairment Assessment for Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets As described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's other intangible assets balance includes $165.3 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2024. For intangible assets not subject to amortization, management evaluates for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The determination of fair value is based on the relief from royalty method of the income approach, which incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow analysis. Management's discounted cash flow analysis includes assumptions related to forecasted future revenues, royalty rates and discount rates. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the indefinite-lived intangible assets; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumption related to the discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate for the indefinite-lived intangible assets; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the relief from royalty method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the relief from royalty method and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumption used by management related to the discount rate. Evaluating management's assumption related to the discount rate involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was reasonable considering whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company's relief from royalty method and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New York, New York February 20, 2025 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1952.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Description The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company,\" \"IPG,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") is one of the world's premier global advertising and marketing services companies. Our agencies create customized marketing programs for clients that range in scale from large global marketers to regional and local clients. Comprehensive global services are critical to effectively serve our multinational and local clients in markets throughout the world, as they seek to build brands, increase sales of their products and services and gain market share. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, some of which are not wholly owned. Investments in companies over which we do not have control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in companies over which we have neither control nor have the ability to exercise significant influence are recorded at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We have consolidated certain entities meeting the definition of variable interest entities, and the inclusion of these entities does not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation We conduct our business across three reportable segments described in Note 16. The three reportable segments are: Media, Data & Engagement Solutions (\"MD&E\"), Integrated Advertising & Creativity Led Solutions (\"IA&C\"), and Specialized Communications & Experiential Solutions (\"SC&E\"). Cost of services is comprised of the expenses of our revenue-producing operating segments including salaries and related expenses, office and other direct expenses and billable expenses, as well as an allocation of the centrally managed expenses from Corporate and other. Office and other direct expenses include rent expense, professional fees, certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and other costs directly attributable to client engagements. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily the unallocated expenses from Corporate and other excluding depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of the fixed assets and intangible assets of the Company is disclosed as a separate operating expense. Impairment of goodwill is disclosed as a separate operating expense. Restructuring charges in 2024 consist of adjustments to the Company's restructuring actions taken in 2022 and 2020, and primarily relate to real estate actions which were designed to reduce our real estate footprint and to better align our cost structure with revenue. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications and immaterial adjustments have been made to prior-period financial statements to conform to the current-period presentation, including the recast of certain prior period adjustments to reflect the transfer of certain agencies between reportable segments. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A further decline in macroeconomic conditions or increasing interest rates could have a negative impact on these estimates, including the fair value of certain estimates. Revenue Recognition Our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multi-channel advertising and communications, marketing services, including public relations, meeting and event production, sports and entertainment marketing, corporate and brand identity, strategic marketing consulting, and providing marketing data and technology services around the world. Most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and, accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn fees and commissions vary significantly. Our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 30 to 90 days, although our data management contracts typically have non-cancelable terms of more than one year. Our payment terms vary by client, and the time between invoicing date and due date is typically not significant. We generally have the legally enforceable right to payment for all services provided through the end of the contract or termination date. We recognize revenue when we determine our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue as or when we satisfy the performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that IPG will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are distinct performance obligations. We then assess whether we act as an agent or a principal for each identified performance obligation and include revenue within the transaction price for third-party costs when we determine that we act as principal. We typically do not capitalize costs to obtain a contract as these amounts would generally be recognized over a period of one year or less. Revenue before billable expenses, primarily consisting of fees, commissions and performance incentives, represents the amount of our gross billings excluding billable expenses charged to a client. Generally, our compensation is based on a negotiated fixed price, rate per hour, a retainer, commission or volume. The majority of our fees are recognized over time as services are performed, either utilizing a function of hours incurred and rates per hour, as compared to periodically updated estimates to complete, or ratably over the term of the contract. For certain less-frequent commission-based contracts which contain clauses allowing our clients to terminate the arrangement at any time for no compensation, revenue is recognized at a point in time, typically the date of broadcast or publication. We report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue-producing transactions. Contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to mutually agreed-upon qualitative and/or quantitative metrics. Performance incentives are treated as variable consideration which is estimated at contract inception and included in revenue based on the most likely amount earned out of a range of potential outcomes. Our estimates are based on a combination of historical award experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment. These estimates are updated on a periodic basis and are not expected to result in a reversal of a significant amount of the cumulative revenue recognized. The predominant component of billable expenses are third-party vendor costs incurred for performance obligations where we have determined that we are acting as principal. These third-party expenses are generally billed back to our clients. Billable expenses also includes incidental costs incurred in the performance of our services including airfare, mileage, hotel stays, out-of-town meals and telecommunication charges. We record these billable expenses within total revenue with a corresponding offset to operating expenses. In international markets, we may receive rebates or credits from vendors based on transactions entered into on behalf of clients. Rebates and credits are remitted back to our clients in accordance with our contractual requirements or may be retained by us based on the terms of a particular client contract and local law. Amounts owed back to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned. In certain international markets, our media contracts may allow clients to terminate our arrangement at any time for no compensation to the extent that media has not yet run. For those contracts, we do not recognize revenue until the media runs which is the point in time at which we have a legally enforceable right to compensation. In the normal course of business, certain agencies may enter into agreements with media suppliers to purchase an agreed value of media within a fixed timeframe. By entering into these agreements, the agency is taking a risk and may be required to pay a portion or all of the agreed value ahead of media being run. In order to participate in these arrangements and receive an agreed additional benefit from the agency, clients are required to contractually opt in. Performance Obligations Our client contracts may include various goods and services that are capable of being distinct, are distinct within the context of the contract and are therefore accounted for as separate performance obligations. We allocate revenue to each performance obligation in the contract at inception based on its relative standalone selling price. Our advertising businesses include a wide range of services that involve the creation of an advertising idea, concept, campaign, or marketing strategy in order to promote the client's brand (\"creative services\"), and to act as an agent to facilitate the production of advertisements by third-party suppliers (\"production services\"). Our clients can contract us to perform one or both of these services, as they can derive stand-alone benefit from each. Production services can include formatting creative material for different media and communication mediums including digital, large-scale reproduction such as printing and adaptation services, talent engagement and acquisition, television and radio production, and outdoor billboard production. Our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the creative advertising services and those that constitute the production services. Both the creative and production services are sold separately, the client can derive utility from each service on its own, we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle, the services do not significantly modify one another, and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent. As such, we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our advertising contracts. Our media businesses include services to formulate strategic media plans (\"media planning services\") and to act as an agent to purchase media (e.g. television and radio spots, outdoor advertising, digital banners, etc.) from vendors on our clients' behalf (\"media buying services\"). Our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the planning services and those that constitute the buying services. Both the planning and buying services are sold separately, the client can derive utility from each service on its own, we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle, the services do not significantly modify one another, and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent. As such, we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our media contracts. Our events businesses include creative services related to the conception and planning of custom marketing events as well as activation services which entail the carrying out of the event, including, but not limited to, set-up, design and staffing. Additionally, our public relations businesses include a broad range of services, such as strategic planning, social media strategy and the monitoring and development of communication strategies, among others. While our contracts in these businesses may include some or all of these services, we typically identify only one performance obligation in the assessment of our events and public relations contracts as we provide a significant service of integrating the individual services into a combined service for which the customer has contracted. Our data and technology services businesses include data management, data and data strategy, identity resolution, and measurement and analytics products and services. While our contracts in these businesses may include some or all of these services, we typically identify each product and service as an individual performance obligation. We have elected not to disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. The majority of our contracts are for periods of one year or less with the exception of our data management contracts. Principal vs. Agent When a third-party is involved in the delivery of our services to the client, we assess whether or not we are acting as a principal or an agent in the arrangement. The assessment is based on whether we control the specified services at any time before they are transferred to the customer. We have determined that in our events and public relations businesses, we generally act as a principal as our agencies provide a significant service of integrating goods or services provided by third parties into the specified deliverable to our clients. In addition, we have determined that we are responsible for the performance of the third-party suppliers, which are combined with our own services, before transferring those services to the customer. We have also determined that we act as principal when providing creative services and media planning services, as we perform a significant integration service in these transactions. For performance obligations in which we act as principal, we record the gross amount billed to the customer within total revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as billable expenses. In the vast majority of our business, when a third-party is involved in the production of an advertising campaign and for media buying services, we have determined that we act as the agent and are solely arranging for the third-party suppliers to provide services to the customer. Specifically, we do not control the specified services before transferring those services to the customer, we are not primarily responsible for the performance of the third-party services, nor can we redirect those services to fulfill any other contracts. We do not have inventory risk or discretion in establishing pricing in our contracts with customers. For performance obligations for which we act as the agent, we record our revenue as the net amount of our gross billings less amounts remitted to third parties. Cash and Cash Equivalents equivalents are highly liquid investments, which include certificates of deposit, government securities, commercial paper and time deposits with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and are stated at estimated fair value, which approximates cost. Cash is maintained at multiple high-credit-quality financial institutions. Allowance for Expected Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses on expected future uncollectible accounts receivable is estimated based on the aging of accounts receivable, reviews of client credit reports, industry trends and economic indicators, as well as reviews of recent payment history for specific customers. The estimate is based largely on a formula-driven calculation but is supplemented with economic indicators and knowledge of potential write-offs of specific client accounts. Accounts Receivable, Billable to Clients Accounts receivable, billable to clients are primarily comprised of production and media costs that have been incurred but have not yet been billed to clients, as well as fees that have been earned which have not yet been billed to clients. Unbilled amounts are presented in accounts receivable, billable to clients regardless of whether they relate to our fees or production and media costs. A provision is made for unrecoverable costs as deemed appropriate. Accounts Payable Accounts payable includes all operating payables, including those related to all media and production costs. These payables are due within one year. Investments Equity investments with readily determinable fair values, other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting, will be measured at fair value. We regularly review our investments to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may impact the fair value of each investment, with changes to fair value recorded in earnings. We evaluate fair value based on specific information (valuation methodologies, estimates of appraisals, financial statements, etc.) in addition to quoted market price, if available. We consider all known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if a decline in value of an investment has occurred. Derivatives We are exposed to market risk related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. From time to time we enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes, and not for speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on our balance sheet. Changes in fair value are immediately included in earnings if the derivatives are not designated as a hedge instrument or if the derivatives do not qualify as effective hedges. For derivatives designated as hedge instruments, we evaluate for hedge accounting both at inception and throughout the hedge period. If a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, then changes in the fair value of the derivative are offset against the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, then the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to earnings in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in the same period as the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. If a derivative is a net investment hedge, then the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other comprehensive income in the same period as the change in fair value of the underlying hedged foreign investment. Property and Equipment Furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements and buildings are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Furniture and equipment are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 3 to 7 years for furniture and equipment, 10 to 35 years for buildings and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for leasehold improvements. Land is stated at cost and is not depreciated. We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to our enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") systems. Our ERP systems are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are amortized using the straight-line method over 10 years. All other internal use computer software are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 3 to 7 years. Leases As of December 31, 2024, we do not have a material amount of finance leases and the majority of our operating leases, for which we serve as the lessee, consist primarily of real-estate property for our offices around the world. Both the right-of-use asset and lease liability are measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with the asset being subject to adjustments such as initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments, and lease incentives. Many of our leases provide for renewal and/or termination options, as well as escalation clauses, which are also factored into our lease payments when appropriate. The discount rate used to measure the lease asset and liability is determined at the beginning of the lease term using the rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable, or using the Company's collateralized credit-adjusted borrowing rate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method, which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and involves the use of significant estimates, including projections of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples. Considering the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets, as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. We review goodwill as of October 1st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level. We have 10 reporting units that were subject to the 2024 annual impairment testing. Our annual impairment review as of October 1, 2024 did not result in an impairment charge for any of our reporting units. Additionally, we performed an interim impairment test as of August 31, 2024. Refer to Note 9 for details. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The determination of fair value is based on the relief from royalty method of the income approach, which models the cash flows from indefinite-lived intangibles assuming royalties were received under a licensing arrangement. This discounted cash flow analysis includes assumptions related to forecasted future revenues attributable to indefinite-lived intangibles, royalty rates and risk-adjusted discount rates. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered impaired, and an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. Based on this analysis, for the indefinite lived-intangible asset for which we performed a quantitative impairment test as of October 1, 2024, we concluded that it was not impaired because its fair value was in excess of its carrying value. For reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment, or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as \"more likely than not\" that the fair value is less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is performed. For our annual impairment test, we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units' equity to the carrying value of their net assets. The sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is also reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium. Goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired, and no further testing is required. Should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value, then the quantitative impairment test is failed and impaired goodwill is written down to its fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. fair value of each reporting unit for 2024 and 2023 was estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. We review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups. These asset groups are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value. Impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 10 and 15 years. Events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client, the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit, loss of key personnel, the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations. Foreign Currencies The functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders' equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. Foreign currency transactions resulted in a pre-tax loss of $2.2 for the year ended December 31, 2024, a pre-tax loss of $5.7 for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a pre-tax gain of $2.5 for the year ended December 31, 2022. monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. A currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. If this occurs the functional currency of that country is changed to our reporting currency, the U.S. Dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses are recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is \"more likely than not\" that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We evaluate our tax positions using the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold. The factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence, such as past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. We have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require. Redeemable Non-controlling Interests Many of our acquisitions include provisions under which the non-controlling equity owners can require us to purchase additional interests in a subsidiary at their discretion. Payments for these redeemable non-controlling interests may be contingent on projected operating performance and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements. These payments are also subject to revision in accordance with the terms of the agreements. We record these redeemable non-controlling interests in \"mezzanine equity\" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Each reporting period, redeemable non-controlling interests are reported at their estimated redemption value, but not less than their initial fair value. Any adjustment to the redemption value above initial value prior to exercise will also impact retained earnings but will not impact net income. Adjustments as a result of currency translation will affect the redeemable non-controlling interest balance, but do not impact retained earnings or additional paid-in capital. Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\") Basic EPS available to IPG common stockholders equals net income available to IPG common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted EPS equals net income available to IPG common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus any additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive shares had been issued. Diluted EPS reflect the potential dilution that would occur if certain potentially dilutive securities were exercised. The potential issuance of common stock is assumed to occur at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance of the potentially dilutive instrument, if later) and the incremental shares are included using the treasury stock method. The proceeds utilized in applying the treasury stock method consist of the amount, if any, to be paid upon exercise and, as it relates to stock-based compensation, the amount of compensation cost attributed to future service not yet recognized. These proceeds are then assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price of our stock during the period. The incremental shares (difference between the shares assumed to be issued and the shares assumed to be purchased), to the extent they would have been dilutive, are included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation. We may be required to calculate basic EPS using the two-class method as a result of our redeemable non-controlling interests. To the extent that the redemption value increases and exceeds the then-current fair value of a redeemable non-controlling interest, net income available to IPG common stockholders (used to calculate EPS) could be negatively impacted by that increase, subject to certain limitations. The partial or full recovery of any reductions to net income available to IPG common stockholders (used to calculate EPS) is limited to any cumulative prior-period reductions. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there was no impact to EPS for adjustments related to our redeemable non-controlling interests. Pension and Postretirement Benefits We have pension and postretirement benefit plans covering certain domestic and international employees. We use various actuarial methods and assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations, including the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefits, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. The overfunded or underfunded status of our pension and postretirement benefit plans is recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation costs related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements based on fair value. Stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures. Treasury Stock We account for repurchased common stock under the cost method and include such treasury stock as a component of our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Upon retirement, we reduce common stock for the par value of the shares being retired and the excess of the cost of the shares over par value as a reduction to APIC, to the extent there is APIC in the same class of stock, and any remaining amount to retained earnings. These retired shares remain authorized but unissued. In October 2024, we retired 11.6 shares of our treasury stock, which resulted in a reduction in common stock of $1.2, treasury stock of $364.5 and APIC of $363.4. In October 2023, we retired 9.3 shares of our treasury stock, which resulted in a reduction in common stock of $0.9, treasury stock of $340.4 and APIC of $339.5. In October 2022, we retired $7.2 shares of our treasury stock, which resulted in a reduction in common stock of $0.7, treasury stock of $199.9 and APIC of $199.2. Note 2: Planned Acquisition of IPG by Omnicom On December 8, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Omnicom Group Inc. (\"Omnicom\") and EXT Subsidiary Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom (\"Merger Sub\"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into IPG, with IPG surviving the merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom. As a result of the merger, each share of IPG common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than certain excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.344 shares of Omnicom common stock and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares. The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to closing the merger. Following the close of the transaction, Omnicom shareholders will own 60.6% of the combined company and IPG shareholders will own 39.4%, on a fully diluted basis. As a result of the merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants. The stock-for-stock transaction is expected to be tax-free to IPG shareholders and is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to Omnicom and IPG shareholder approvals, required domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if Omnicom terminates the agreement (i) following a change or withdrawal of the recommendation of the IPG's board of directors to IPG stockholders to approve the merger, or (ii) as a result of a willful and material breach of our non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, then we will be obligated to pay a termination fee of $439.0 to Omnicom (the \"IPG Termination Fee\"). We will also be obligated to pay the IPG Termination Fee if (i) the IPG shareholders fail to approve the merger (and Omnicom has obtained shareholder approval), or (ii) we breach the Merger Agreement in a manner that Omnicom's closing conditions not being satisfied and the breach cannot be cured by the specified outside date and, in any such case, within 12 months after the termination date a competing proposal to acquire 50% or more of the business, assets or outstanding shares of IPG has been publicly announced and consummated, or a definitive agreement in respect of such competing proposal has been signed. We will also be required to reimburse up to $25.0 of Omnicom's merger-related fees, costs and expenses if the Merger Agreement is terminated as a result of the failure of the IPG shareholders to approve the merger (and Omnicom has obtained shareholder approval). During the fourth quarter of 2024, $9.3 of deal costs were incurred related to the planned acquisition of IPG by Omnicom, which were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.

December 31, December 31, Accounts receivable, net of allowance of $37.0 and $46.4, respectively 5,649.7 5,768.8 Accounts receivable, billable to clients 2,088.4 2,229.2 Contract assets Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) 509.0 684.7 Contract assets are primarily comprised of contract incentives that are generally satisfied annually under the terms of our contracts and are transferred to accounts receivable when the right to payment becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities relate to advance consideration received from customers under the terms of our contracts primarily related to reimbursements of third-party expenses, whether we act as principal or agent, and to a lesser extent, periodic retainer fees, both of which are generally recognized shortly after billing. The majority of our contracts are for periods of one year or less with the exception of our data management contracts. For those contracts with a term of more than one year, we had approximately $598.5 of unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2024, which will be recognized as services are performed over the remaining contractual terms through 2030. Note 4: Leases As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our operating leases, for which we serve as the lessee, consist primarily of real-estate property for our offices around the world, and we do not have a material amount of finance leases. Both the right-of-use asset and lease liability are measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with the asset being subject to adjustments such as initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments, and lease incentives. Many of our leases provide for renewal and/or termination options, as well as escalation clauses, which are also factored into our lease payments when appropriate. As of December 31, 2024, our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 12 years. The discount rate used to measure the lease asset and liability is determined at the beginning of the lease term using the rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable, or using the Company's collateralized credit-adjusted borrowing rate. The following tables present information on our operating leases for the full years of 2024, 2023 and 2022 Years ended December 31, Operating lease cost 266.1 268.4 290.7 Short-term lease cost Sublease income (30.1 (26.4 (23.8 Total lease cost 241.4 249.9 273.3 Cash paid related to operating lease liabilities 302.6 299.5 320.9 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities 109.4 As of December 31, Weighted-average remaining lease term Seven years Seven years Eight years Weighted-average discount rate Our future payments of our operating leases as of December 31, 2024 are listed in the table below.

Note 5: Debt and Credit Arrangements Long-Term Debt summary of the carrying amounts of our long-term debt is listed below. Effective Interest December 31, 4.200% Senior Notes due 2024 4.240 249.9 4.650% Senior Notes due 2028 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $0.7 and $1.7, respectively) 4.780 497.6 497.0 4.750% Senior Notes due 2030 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $2.2 and $3.2, respectively) 4.920 644.6 643.6 2.400% Senior Notes due 2031 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $0.5 and $2.9, respectively) 2.512 496.6 496.0 5.375% Senior Notes due 2033 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $3.3 and $2.7, respectively) 5.650 294.0 293.4 3.375% Senior Notes due 2041 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $0.9 and $4.7, respectively) 3.448 494.4 494.1 5.400% Senior Notes due 2048 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $2.5 and $4.4, respectively) 5.480 493.1 492.8 Other notes payable and capitalized leases Total long-term debt 2,920.6 3,167.6 Less: current portion 250.1 Long-term debt, excluding current portion 2,920.5 2,917.5 See Note 14 for information on the fair value measurement of our long-term debt. Annual maturities are scheduled as follows based on the book value as of December 31, 2024. 497.7 Thereafter 2,422.6 Total long-term debt 2,920.6 For those debt securities that have a premium or discount at the time of issuance, we amortize the amount through interest expense based on the maturity date or the first date the holders may require us to repurchase the debt securities, if applicable. A premium would result in a decrease in interest expense, and a discount would result in an increase in interest expense in future periods. Additionally, we have debt issuance costs related to certain financing transactions which are also amortized through interest expense. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had total unamortized debt issuance costs of $23.7 and $22.7, respectively. Our debt securities include covenants that, among other things, limit our liens and the liens of certain of our consolidated subsidiaries, but do not require us to maintain any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt was $2,702.0 and $2,975.3, respectively. Refer to Note 14 for details. Debt Transactions 4.200% Senior Notes due 2024 Our 4.200% unsecured senior notes in aggregate principal amount of $250.0 matured on April 15, 2024. We used cash on hand to fund the principal repayment. Credit Arrangement We maintain a committed corporate credit facility, originally dated as of July 18, 2008, which has been amended and restated from time to time (the \"Credit Agreement\"). We use our Credit Agreement to increase our financial flexibility, to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries and to support our commercial paper program. On May 29, 2024, we amended and restated the Credit Agreement. As amended, among other things, the maturity date of the Credit Agreement was extended to May 29, 2029 and the cost structure of the Credit Agreement was changed. The Credit Agreement continues to include a required leverage ratio, of not more than 3.50 to 1.00, among other customary covenants like limitations on our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary debt. At the election of the Company, the leverage ratio may be changed to not more than 4.00 to 1.00 for four consecutive quarters, beginning with the fiscal quarter in which there is an occurrence of one or more acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of at least $200.0. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $1,500.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. The Company has the ability to increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to $250.0, provided the Company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of $50.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement; however, we had $9.3 and $9.5 of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, which reduced our total availability to $1,490.7 and $1,490.5, respectively. In addition to other customary covenants, we are required to maintain the financial covenant listed below as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended pursuant to our Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with all of our covenants in the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024. Under the Credit Agreement, we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2024, the applicable margin was 0.125% for Base Rate advances and 1.125% for Eurocurrency Rate borrowings. Letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding, at a rate equal to the applicable margin for Eurocurrency rate advances, and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 0.250%. We also pay a facility fee on each lender's revolving commitment of 0.125%, which is an annual rate determined based on our credit ratings. Financial Covenant Leverage ratio (not greater than): 3.50x The leverage ratio is defined as debt as of the last day of such fiscal quarter to EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement, for the four quarters then ended. Uncommitted Lines of Credit We also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates and that are primarily used to fund working capital needs. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit in an aggregate amount of $769.1 and $780.7, under which we had outstanding borrowings of $40.5 and $34.2 classified as short-term borrowings on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively. The average amounts outstanding during 2024 and 2023 were $44.0 and $47.9, respectively, with weighted-average interest rates of approximately 7.6% and 7.9%, respectively. Commercial Paper The Company is authorized to issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1,500.0. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by the Credit Agreement described above. Commercial paper proceeds are used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness and other short-term liquidity needs. Commercial paper maturities vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no commercial paper outstanding. There was no outstanding commercial paper under the program during both 2024 and 2023. Cash Pooling We aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis. Outside the United States, we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements. In these pooling arrangements, several IPG agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of set-off against amounts other agencies owe the bank, and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all agencies does not exceed an agreed-upon level. Typically, each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances. Our Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect cash, net of bank overdrafts, under all of our pooling arrangements, and as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 the amounts netted were $2,132.7 and $2,718.0, respectively. Note 6: Earnings Per Share The following sets forth basic and diluted earnings per common share available to IPG common stockholders. Years ended December 31, Net income available to IPG common stockholders 689.5 1,098.4 938.0 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding - basic 375.2 384.1 391.5 Dilutive effect of stock options and restricted shares Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding - diluted 377.7 385.9 395.1 Earnings per share available to IPG common stockholders: Basic Diluted Note 7: Acquisitions We continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to expand our industry expertise, strengthen our position in high-growth and key strategic geographical markets and industry sectors, advance technological capabilities and improve operational efficiency through both acquisitions and increased ownership interests in current investments. Our acquisitions typically provide for an initial payment at the time of closing and additional contingent purchase price payments based on the future performance of the acquired entity. We have entered into agreements that may require us to purchase additional equity interests in certain consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries. The amounts at which we record these transactions in our financial statements are based on estimates of the future financial performance of the acquired entity, the timing of the exercise of these rights, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors. During 2024, no acquisitions occurred and we did not record any additional goodwill or other intangible assets related to acquisitions. On December 3, 2024, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of an e-commerce intelligence platform, the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025 for a cash payment of $50.4, subject to customary closing adjustments. During 2023, we completed two acquisitions, one of which was included in the IA&C reportable segment, and one of which was included in the SC&E reportable segment. We paid $2.6, net of cash acquired and recorded approximately $11.7 of goodwill and $8.5 of other intangible assets related to the acquisitions. During 2022, we completed one acquisition, recorded in the MD&E reportable segment. On September 23, 2022, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire approximately 83.9% of the outstanding shares of RafterOne with options to purchase the remaining outstanding shares. The transaction closed on October 3, 2022, subject to customary closing adjustments. We paid $232.2, net of cash acquired, related to the acquisition. The purpose of the acquisition is to combine the Company's media, creative, marketing services and analytics capabilities, global scale and consumer insights, with RafterOne's Salesforce capabilities for commerce, service, data, marketing and customer experience. We recorded approximately $211.7 of goodwill, of which approximately $2.2 was recorded during 2023, and $62.0 of other intangible assets related to the acquisition of RafterOne. The results of operations of our acquired companies were included in our consolidated results from the closing date of each acquisition. We did not make any payments in stock related to our acquisitions in 2024, 2023 or 2022. Details of cash paid for current and prior years' acquisitions are listed below. Years ended December 31, Cost of investment: current-year acquisitions 235.4 Cost of investment: prior-year acquisitions Less: net cash acquired Total cost of investment 241.5 Operating payments Total cash paid for acquisitions 251.1 Represents cash payments for amounts that have been recognized in operating expenses since the date of acquisition either relating to adjustments to estimates in excess of the initial value of contingent payments recorded or were contingent upon the future employment of the former owners of the acquired companies. Amounts are reflected in the operating section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Of the total cash paid for acquisitions, $0.0, $6.3 and $232.2 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are classified under the investing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as acquisitions, net of cash acquired. These amounts relate to initial payments for new transactions, as well as adjustments made to upfront payments related to prior year acquisitions. Of the total cash paid for acquisitions, $9.0, $12.9 and $9.3 for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are classified under the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as acquisition-related payments. These amounts relate to deferred payments and increases in our ownership interest for prior acquisitions. For companies acquired, we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities based on 100% of the business for consolidation. The purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets acquired is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and then to goodwill. Due to the characteristics of advertising, specialized marketing and communication services companies, our acquisitions typically do not have significant amounts of tangible assets since the principal assets we acquire are client relationships and talent. As a result, a substantial portion of the purchase price is primarily allocated to customer lists, trade names and goodwill. For acquisitions, we record deferred payment and redeemable non-controlling interest amounts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on their acquisition-date fair value. Deferred payments are recorded on a discounted basis and adjusted quarterly, if necessary, through operating income or net interest expense, depending on the nature of the arrangement, for both changes in estimate and accretion between the acquisition date and the final payment date. See Note 17 for further information on contingent acquisition obligations. Redeemable non-controlling interests are adjusted quarterly, if necessary, to their estimated redemption value, but not less than their initial fair value. Any adjustments to the redemption value impact retained earnings or additional paid in capital, except for foreign currency translation adjustments. The following table presents changes in our redeemable non-controlling interests. Years ended December 31, Balance at beginning of period Change in related non-controlling interests balance Changes in redemption value of redeemable non-controlling interests: Additions Redemptions and other Redemption value adjustments Currency translation adjustments Balance at end of period For all acquisitions, if a portion of the deferred payments and purchases of additional interests after the effective date of purchase are contingent upon employment terms, then that amount is accounted for separately from the business combination and recognized as compensation expense over the required earn-out period. Payments deemed as compensation are excluded from the fair value purchase price allocation to tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired.

Years ended December 31, Net gains/(losses) on sales of businesses (64.2 (11.3 Other (11.7 Total other (expense) income, net (75.9 Net gains/(losses) on sales of businesses - During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amounts recognized were related to sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets and liabilities, consisting primarily of goodwill, accounts receivable and accounts payable, as held for sale within our MD&E, IA&C, and SC&E reportable segments. The businesses held for sale as of year-end primarily represent unprofitable, non-strategic agencies which are expected to be sold within the next twelve months. During 2024, the amounts recognized were primarily related to two digital specialist agencies within our MD&E segment classified as held for sale during the third quarter of 2024. The sale of one of these businesses closed in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the sale of the other is expected to close in the first half of 2025. The sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets and liabilities as held for sale included cash, net of proceeds, of $7.9, $58.7 and $(22.4) for the years ended 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which is classified within the Proceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold line in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Other - During 2024, the majority of the amounts recognized were primarily related to pension and postretirement costs. During 2023, the majority of the amounts recognized were primarily related to pension and postretirement costs. During 2022, the majority of the amounts recognized were primarily related to a cash gain from the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by a non-cash loss related to the deconsolidation of a previously consolidated entity in which we maintain an equity interest. Held for Sale Long-lived assets (disposal group) to be sold are classified as held for sale in the period which all criteria are met. The Company measures assets (disposal group) held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. During the third quarter of 2024, management determined that the assets and liabilities of R/GA, one of our digital specialist agencies within our MD&E segment, met the criteria to be presented as held for sale. The planned disposal is expected to be completed within twelve months of designation and does not constitute a strategic shift of the Company's operations and therefore does not meet the discontinued operations criteria. The Company recorded a loss within net losses on sales of businesses included in Other (expense) income, net, upon classification as held for sale for the disposal group to adjust its carrying value to fair value less cost to sell. This is presented as a valuation allowance of $71.1 on the group of assets held for sale, without allocation to the individual assets or major classes of assets within the group. Any differences due to changes in fair values less costs to sell or carrying values for the disposal group will be recognized as a gain or loss in future financial statements. See further discussion below in the \"Goodwill\" section within Note 9. The following table sets provides a reconciliation of the carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale, respectively, to the amounts presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.

On February 8, 2023, the Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $350.0, excluding fees, of our common stock, which was in addition to any amounts remaining under the 2022 share repurchase program. On February 7, 2024, the Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $320.0, excluding fees, of our common stock, which was in addition to any amounts remaining under the 2023 share repurchase program. On February 11, 2025, the Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $155.0, excluding fees, of our common stock, which was in addition to any amounts remaining under the 2024 share repurchase program. We may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") rules, derivative transactions or other means. The timing and amount of repurchases in future periods will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements. The following table presents our share repurchase activity under our share repurchase programs for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Years ended December 31, Number of shares repurchased Aggregate cost, including fees 230.1 350.2 320.1 Average price per share, including fees 31.40 33.64 31.01 The amount for twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 excludes $1.9 and $2.5 of estimated excise tax on net share repurchases, respectfully.

Note 9: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is the excess purchase price remaining from an acquisition after an allocation of purchase price has been made to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. The Company transferred certain agencies between operating segments as of January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024, respectively, which resulted in certain changes to our reporting units and reportable segments. We have allocated goodwill to our reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior and subsequent to the reallocations and determined that no impairment existed. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill for our reportable segments, MD&E, IA&C and SC&E, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are listed below. Total 1 Balance as of December 31, 2022 2,487.6 1,878.6 684.4 5,050.6 Goodwill Reallocation 180.6 (180.6 Balance as of January 1, 2023 2,668.2 1,698.0 684.4 5,050.6 Acquisitions/(Dispositions) Foreign currency and other Balance as of December 31, 2023 2,677.5 1,723.2 680.2 5,080.9 Goodwill Reallocation (13.3 Balance as of January 1, 2024 2,690.8 1,709.9 680.2 5,080.9 Impairment of goodwill (232.1 (232.1 (Dispositions)/Acquisitions (116.5 (117.6 Foreign currency and other (26.9 (41.8 Balance as of December 31, 2024 2,332.8 1,681.8 674.8 4,689.4 The amounts for our MD&E segment includes impairment of $24.9 related to a disposal group. The amounts for the year ended December 31, 2024 within our MD&E segment represents goodwill allocated to businesses which were held for sale as of the third quarter of 2024. The sale of one of these businesses closed in the fourth quarter of 2024. The goodwill balances at December 31, 2024 includes $207.2 of accumulated impairment related to the MD&E reportable segment. The accumulated impairment relates to impairment charges recorded during the third quarter of 2024. Q3 2024 Interim Goodwill Test During the third quarter of 2024, we concluded that declines in the forecasted performance of one of our reporting units included within our MD&E segment, combined with the classification of R/GA and Huge, which comprised a significant portion of the reporting unit, as held for sale was a triggering event which required a goodwill impairment assessment. As of August 31, 2024, we performed a pre-classification goodwill impairment test and determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and therefore, goodwill of the reporting unit was impaired. The Company completed an analysis to allocate goodwill to the remaining reporting unit, R/GA and Huge using a relative fair value approach. Additionally, we performed a post-classification goodwill impairment test on R/GA and Huge, as well as an impairment test of the businesses remaining within the reporting unit. We determined that the carrying value of one disposal group exceeded its fair value and goodwill was impaired. As a result of both the pre-classification and post-classification impairment tests, the Company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $232.1. We concluded that the fair value of the remaining reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and the remaining reporting unit was not impaired. The fair value of both the reporting unit pre-classification and the fair values of the disposal groups and the remaining reporting unit that is in our ongoing operations for which we performed the quantitative interim impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method, and the market approach, which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data. We generally apply an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our quantitative impairment test analysis, although higher weighting was given to the market approach for determining the fair value of disposal groups. For the income approach, we used projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to the reporting unit and disposal groups include revenue growth, profit margins, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates, discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. For the market approach, we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable-company market multiples. Additionally, our determination of the market approach for the disposal groups also considered ranges of initial offers received as part of the sale process. The discount rate used for the reporting unit and disposal groups is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit. For the interim impairment tests of goodwill, the discount rates used ranged from 14.5% to 22.0%, and the terminal value growth rates were 2.5% and 3.0%. The terminal value growth rates represent the expected long-term growth rates. The revenue growth rates utilized in the interim impairment tests were between (2.0%) and 6.0%. Factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit and disposal groups provide for its clients, the geographic locations in which the reporting unit and disposal groups conduct business and the maturity of the reporting units and disposal groups. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable, but they are susceptible to change from period to period. Actual results of operations, cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation, and it is possible that differences and changes could be material. A deterioration in profitability, adverse market conditions, significant client losses, changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and could result in an impairment charge in the future. See Note 1 for information regarding our annual impairment testing methodology. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets primarily consist of customer lists and know-how and technology, which have definite lives and are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives generally between 10 and 15 years, as well as trade names which have both indefinite and definite lives which are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives of 15 years. Amortization expense for other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $81.8, $84.0 and $84.7, respectively. There were no material impairment charges on other intangibles for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. During 2024 there were no other intangible assets related to our acquisitions, and during 2023 we recorded approximately $8.5 of other intangible assets related to our acquisitions. The following table provides a summary of other intangible assets, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In 2024, our effective income tax rate of 31.8% was negatively impacted by the net tax expense on entities classified as held for sale, a reduced tax benefit on impairment of goodwill, and by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. Our income tax expense was positively impacted by the reversal of reserves resulting from the lapse of statute for the 2020 federal tax year and the settlement of the 2017 through 2019 New York State income tax audit. The OECD's global tax reform initiative (known as Pillar 2) is aimed at ensuring multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax in all countries in which they operate, beginning with 2024. The adoption of these guidelines did not have a material impact on our current and deferred tax positions in 2024. In 2023, our effective income tax rate of 20.7% was positively impacted by a benefit of $64.2 related to the settlement of the 2017 and 2018 U.S. Federal income tax audit. The effective rate also benefited from the net release of previously recorded reserves for various other tax contingencies, and the excess tax benefits on employee share-based payments, the majority of which were recognized in the first quarter due to the timing of the vesting of awards. In 2022, our effective income tax rate of 25.1% was adversely impacted by the establishment of net valuation allowances primarily in Continental Europe, and by net losses on sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets as held for sale for which we received minimal tax benefit. This was partially offset by excess tax benefits on employee share-based payments, the majority of which were recognized in the first quarter due to the timing of the vesting of awards and by the release of previously recorded reserves for tax contingencies. The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are listed below. December 31, Postretirement/post-employment benefits Deferred compensation Pension costs Interest Accruals and reserves Allowance for credit losses Basis differences in fixed assets 121.3 Operating lease liabilities 288.9 322.7 Tax loss/tax credit carry forwards 244.2 260.4 Other Deferred tax assets 864.3 874.2 Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (173.1 (162.5 Net deferred tax assets 691.2 711.7 Basis differences in fixed assets Basis differences in intangible assets (386.5 (395.3 Operating lease right-of-use assets (229.6 (252.8 Prepaid expenses (11.4 Deferred revenue Unremitted foreign earnings Deferred tax liabilities (633.1 (668.3 Total net deferred tax assets As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred tax assets of $249.2 and $265.0, respectively, and deferred tax liabilities of $191.1 and $221.6, respectively, were separately included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet under Deferred income taxes and Other non-current liabilities. We evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. The realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced or increased in the near future if estimates of future taxable income are lower or greater than anticipated. A valuation allowance is established when it is \"more likely than not\" that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In circumstances where there is negative evidence, establishment of a valuation allowance is considered. The factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence, such as past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. We believe that cumulative losses in the most recent three-year period represent significant negative evidence, and as a result, we determined that certain of our deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets for which an allowance was recognized relate primarily to state and foreign tax loss carryforwards. The change in the valuation allowance is listed below. Years ended December 31, Balance at beginning of period 162.5 145.8 146.0 Charged (reversed) to costs and expenses Charged to gross tax assets and other accounts Foreign currency translation (11.3 Balance at end of period 173.1 162.5 145.8 Primarily represents changes to the valuation allowance related to the change of a corresponding deferred tax asset. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, amounts recorded and reversed to costs and expenses primarily related to increases and decreases in valuation allowances in Asia Pacific, Continental Europe and North America for existing deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2024, there were $872.9 of loss carryforwards. These loss carryforwards were all non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards, of which $772.0 have unlimited carryforward periods and $100.9 have expiration periods from 2025 to 2043. As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had $19.8 in deferred tax assets for state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, which will expire between 2025 and 2045. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $1,823.9 and $1,633.6, respectively, of undistributed earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries. The Company has historically asserted that its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested, and therefore has not recorded any deferred taxes on such amounts. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax on these undistributed earnings because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances that exist if and when a remittance occurs, including the source location and amount of the distribution and foreign withholding taxes. The table below summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits. Years ended December 31, Balance at beginning of period 291.0 283.5 262.6 Increases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior year Decreases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior year (34.4 (68.2 (10.1 Settlements with taxing authorities Lapse of statutes of limitation (16.3 (11.4 Increases as a result of tax positions taken during the current year Balance at end of period 305.8 291.0 283.5 Included in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of $305.8 as of December 31, 2024, is $271.7 of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective income tax rate. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is $49.3 and $38.5, respectively, of which expenses of $10.8 and $2.5 are included in our 2024 and 2023 Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. In accordance with our accounting policy, interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have various tax years under examination by tax authorities in the U.S., in various countries, and in various states and localities, such as New York City, in which we have significant business operations. It is not yet known whether these examinations will, in the aggregate, result in our paying additional taxes. We believe our tax reserves are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and, if necessary, adjust our reserves as additional information or events require. With respect to all tax years open to examination by U.S. federal, various state and local, and non-U.S. tax authorities, we currently anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by an amount between $95.0 and $105.0 in the next twelve months, a portion of which will affect our effective income tax rate, primarily as a result of the settlement of tax examinations and the lapsing of statutes of limitations. This net decrease is related to various items of income and expense, primarily transfer pricing adjustments. We are effectively settled with respect to U.S. federal income tax audits through 2020. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local income tax audits for years prior to 2015 or non-U.S. income tax audits for years prior to 2011.

The amounts for the year ended December 31, 2022 represent 2022 Real Estate Actions, as well as adjustments to the actions taken in 2020. The 2022 Real Estate Actions did not include any severance and termination costs. Lease and Other restructuring costs include impairments of operating lease right-of-use assets and associated leasehold improvements, furniture and asset retirement obligations. Lease impairments were calculated based on estimated fair values using market participant assumptions including forecasted net discounted cash flows related to the operating lease right-of-use assets. 2022 Real Estate Actions In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company took Real Estate Actions related to new real estate exits and lease terminations to further optimize the real estate footprint supporting our office-home hybrid service model in a post-pandemic economy. All included opportunities for further efficiencies as a result of the current working environment were identified and completed during the fourth quarter of 2022. These Real Estate Actions, taken during the fourth quarter of 2022, reduced our occupied global real estate footprint by approximately 6.7% or 500,000 square feet. All restructuring actions were identified and initiated in 2022, with all actions completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. A summary of the restructuring activities related to the 2022 Real Estate Actions as of the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows: Liability at December 31, 2022 Real Estate Actions Restructuring Expense Non-Cash Items Payments Liability at December 31, 2024 Lease impairment costs Other restructuring costs Total A summary of the restructuring activities related to the 2022 Real Estate Actions as of the year ended December 31, 2023 is as follows: 2022 Real Estate Actions Liability at December 31, 2022 Restructuring Expense Non-Cash Items Payments Liability at December 31, 2023 Lease impairment costs Other restructuring costs Total A summary of the restructuring activities related to the 2022 Real Estate Actions as of the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: 2022 Real Estate Actions Restructuring Expense Non-Cash Items Cash Payments Liability at December 31, 2022 Lease impairment costs Other restructuring costs Total A summary of the restructuring activities related to the 2022 Real Estate Actions by segment is as follows: Years ended December 31, Restructuring charges: Corporate and other Total Non cash lease impairment costs: Corporate and other Total 2020 Restructuring Plan Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, the Company took restructuring actions to lower its operating expenses structurally and permanently relative to revenue and to accelerate the transformation of our business (the \"2020 Plan\"). All restructuring actions were identified and initiated in 2020, with all actions completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 and were based on our experience and learning in the COVID-19 pandemic and a resulting review of our operations to address certain operating expenses such as occupancy expense and salaries and related expenses.

In May 2019, our shareholders approved the 2019 Performance Incentive Plan (the \"2019 PIP\"), replacing the 2014 Performance Incentive Plan (the \"2014 PIP\") and previous incentive plans. The number of shares of common stock initially available for grants of all equity awards under the 2019 PIP is 27.0. Pursuant to the terms of the 2019 PIP, the number of shares that may be awarded to any one participant for any stock based awards is limited to 2.0. The vesting period of awards granted is generally commensurate with the requisite service period. We generally issue new shares to satisfy the exercise of stock options or the distribution of other stock-based awards. Additionally, under the 2019 PIP, we have the ability to issue performance cash awards. The performance cash awards are granted to certain employees who otherwise would have been eligible to receive performance-based stock awards. These awards have a service period vesting condition and a performance vesting condition. The amount of the performance cash award received by an employee with a performance vesting condition can range from 0% to 300% of the target amount of the original grant value, except for Executive Officers of IPG, with a range of 0% to 200%. Performance cash awards generally vest in three years. The Compensation Committee may grant performance cash awards to any eligible employee; however, no employee can receive more than $10.0 during a performance period. The amounts of stock-based compensation expense as reflected in salaries and related expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the related tax benefit, are listed below. Years ended December 31, Stock-settled awards Cash-settled awards Performance-based awards Stock Options Employee stock purchase plan Other Stock-based compensation expense Tax benefit Represents charges recorded for severance expense related to stock-based compensation awards. Stock Options Stock options are granted with the exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions including the option's expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. They are generally first exercisable between two and four years from the grant date and expire ten years after the grant date (or earlier in the case of certain terminations of employment). There were no stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2024, no stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2023 and no stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes our stock option activity during 2024. Options Weighted- Average Exercise Price (per option) Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Stock options outstanding as of January 1, 2024 23.33 Granted Exercised Stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2024 23.33 There were no stock options exercised in 2024, 2023, and 2022. Stock-Based Compensation We grant other stock-based compensation awards such as stock-settled awards, cash-settled awards and performance-based awards (settled in cash or shares) to certain key employees. The number of shares or units received by an employee for performance-based awards depends on Company performance against specific performance targets and could range from 0% to 300% of the target amount of shares originally granted, except for Executive Officers of IPG, with a range of 0% to 200%. Incentive awards are subject to certain restrictions and vesting requirements as determined by the Compensation Committee. The fair value of the shares on the grant date is amortized over the vesting period, which is generally three years. Upon completion of the vesting period for cash-settled awards, the grantee is entitled to receive a payment in cash based on the fair market value of the corresponding number of shares of common stock. No monetary consideration is paid by a recipient for any incentive award. The fair value of cash-settled awards is adjusted each quarter based on our share price. The holders of certain stock-settled awards have the right to receive dividends. Dividends declared on common stock are accrued during the vesting period and paid when the award vests. The holders of performance-based awards have no ownership interest in the underlying shares of common stock until the awards vest and the shares of common stock are issued. Stock-based compensation awards expected to be settled in cash have been classified as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

A summary of the activity of our non-vested stock-settled awards, cash-settled awards and performance-based awards during 2024 is presented below (performance-based awards are shown at 100% of the shares originally granted).

Under the Cash Plan, the Board, the Compensation Committee or the Plan Administrator may grant cash awards to certain employees eligible to receive cash-settled awards. Cash awards, when granted, have a service-period vesting condition and generally vest in two years or three years. Cash Awards During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Compensation Committee granted cash awards under the Cash Plans with a total target value of $17.1, $20.4 and $19.9, respectively. For those same years, we recognized $16.7, $31.5 and $42.0, respectively, in salaries and related expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Compensation Committee granted performance awards to be settled in cash under the 2019 PIP with a total target value of $1.5, $46.2, and $46.0, respectively. For those same years, we recognized $19.5, $38.0 and $44.7, respectively, in salaries and related expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We amortize the present value of the amount expected to vest for cash awards and performance cash awards over the vesting period using the straight-line method, less an assumed forfeiture rate. Cash awards do not fall within the scope of the authoritative guidance for stock compensation as they are not paid in equity and the value of the award is not correlated with our stock price. Due to the cash nature of the payouts and the vesting period, we account for these awards in accordance with authoritative guidance for deferred compensation arrangements. Employee Stock Purchase Plans In May 2016, our shareholders approved The Interpublic Group of Companies Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2016) (the \"ESPP\"), replacing the prior employee stock purchase plan under which, prior to its expiration on December 31, 2015, 3.0 shares were issued. Under the ESPP, eligible employees may purchase our common stock through payroll deductions not exceeding 10% of their eligible compensation or 900 (actual number) shares each offering period, consistent with the prior employee stock purchase plan. The price an employee pays for a share of common stock under the ESPP is 90% of the lesser of the average market price of a share on the first business day of the offering period or the average market price of a share on the last business day of the offering period of three months. An aggregate of approximately 10.0 shares are reserved for issuance under the ESPP, of which 3.7 shares have been issued since the inception of the ESPP through December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 0.6 shares with a value of $17.9 were issued under the ESPP. Note 14: Fair Value Measurements Authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Financial Instruments that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We primarily apply the market approach to determine the fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no changes to our valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of financial instruments during 2024 as compared to the prior year. The following tables present information about our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. December 31, 2024 Balance Sheet Classification Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Cash equivalents 1,139.5 1,139.5 Cash and cash equivalents Liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations Accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities December 31, 2023 Balance Sheet Classification Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Cash equivalents 1,521.5 1,521.5 Cash and cash equivalents Liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations Accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations includes deferred acquisition payments and unconditional obligations to purchase additional non-controlling equity shares of consolidated subsidiaries. Fair value measurement of the obligations is based upon actual and projected operating performance targets as specified in the related agreements. The increase in this balance of $2.4 from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 is primarily due to the exercises of redeemable non-controlling interest, as well as valuation adjustments, partially offset by payments related to our deferred acquisitions from prior-year acquisitions. The amounts payable within the next twelve months are classified in accrued liabilities; any amounts payable thereafter are classified in other non-current liabilities. Financial Instruments that are not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table presents information about our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total long-term debt 2,701.6 2,702.0 2,974.5 2,975.3 Our long-term debt is comprised of senior notes and other notes payable. The fair value of our senior notes, which are traded over-the-counter, is based on quoted prices in markets that are not active. Therefore, these senior notes are classified as Level 2. Our other notes payable are not actively traded, and their fair value is not solely derived from readily observable inputs. The fair value of our other notes payable is determined based on a discounted cash flow model and other proprietary valuation methods, and therefore is classified as Level 3. See Note 5 for further information on our long-term debt. The discount rates used as significant unobservable inputs in the Level 3 fair value measurements of our contingent acquisition obligations and long-term debt as of December 31, 2024 ranged from 4.0% to 6.0%. Non-financial Instruments that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Certain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, primarily goodwill (Level 3), intangible assets, and property and equipment. Accordingly, these assets are not measured and adjusted to fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to periodic evaluations for potential impairment. Note 15: Employee Benefits Pension and Postretirement Benefit We have a defined benefit pension plan covering certain U.S. employees (the \"Domestic Pension Plan\") that consists of approximately 2,600 participants and is closed to new participants. We also have numerous funded and unfunded plans outside the U.S. The Interpublic Limited Pension Plan in the U.K. (the \"U.K. Pension Plan\") is a defined benefit plan and is our most material foreign pension plan in terms of the benefit obligation and plan assets. Some of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries provide postretirement health benefits and life insurance to eligible employees and, in certain cases, their dependents. The domestic postretirement benefit plan is our most material postretirement benefit plan in terms of the benefit obligation. This plan consists of approximately 1,300 participants, is closed to new participants and is unfunded. Differences between the aggregate income statement and balance sheet amounts listed in the tables below and the totals reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Balance Sheets relate to non-material foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans. In December 2023, the U. K. Pension Plan entered into an agreement with an insurance company to purchase a group annuity, or \"buy-in\", that matches the plans future projected benefit obligations to covered participants. Prior to the transaction, the Company contributed an incremental $46.0 to the U.K. Pension Plan. As part of the annuity purchase contract, the U.K. Pension Plan has the option to complete a \"buy-out\", which would transfer all liabilities of the plan to the insurer, which the Company anticipates to be completed in 2026. The non-cash settlement charge, net of tax, associated with the transaction is currently estimated to be approximately $180.0 to $200.0 and is subject to finalization of terms and changes in the British Pound Sterling. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligation The change in the benefit obligation, the change in plan assets, the funded status and amounts recognized for the Domestic Pension Plan, the significant foreign pension plans and the domestic postretirement benefit plan are listed below.

Actuarial gains of $27.7 for the foreign pension plans are attributed to an increase in the weighted-average discount rate from 4.32% as of December 31, 2023 to 5.13% as of December 31, 2024 and changes in demographic experience.

Using the bond selection/settlement approach, we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments. Using the bond yield curve approach, we determine the discount rate by matching the plans' cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve. Both approaches utilize high-quality AA-rated corporate bonds and the plans' projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments, which is then used to develop a single discount rate. In countries where markets for high-quality long-term AA corporate bonds are not well developed, a portfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields, which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate. Expected Return on Assets Our expected rate of return is determined at the beginning of each year and considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions, current and expected market conditions, risk premiums associated with asset classes and long-term inflation rates. We determine both a short-term and long-term view and then select a long-term rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities. Fair Value of Pension Plan Assets The following table presents the fair value of our domestic and foreign pension plan assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. See Note 14 for a description of the fair value hierarchy. December 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Plan assets subject to fair value hierarchy Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Registered investment companies Limited partnerships Fixed income securities Insurance contracts 291.0 292.3 334.4 335.8 Other Total plan assets, subject to leveling 291.0 324.1 334.4 362.4 Other Plan Assets Other investments measured at net asset value 106.5 Non-benefit obligation liabilities (40.2 Total plan assets 379.3 428.7 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy but are included to reconcile to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets table above. Registered investment companies, which are publicly traded, are primarily valued using recently reported sales prices. Limited partnerships are invested primarily in equity and fixed income securities. Fixed income securities include government and investment-grade corporate bonds. Insurance contracts are valued based on the cash surrender value of the contract. Other investments primarily include cash and cash equivalents, equity securities and derivatives. Other investments measured at net asset value include common/collective trusts, hedge funds and other commingled assets that are invested primarily in equity and fixed income securities. These investments are not publicly traded and are valued based on the net asset value of shares held by the plan at year end, which reflects the fair value of the underlying investments. The following table presents additional information about our significant foreign pension plan assets for which we utilize Level 3 inputs to determine fair value. Years ended December 31, Plan assets subject to fair value hierarchy, Level 3 Balance at beginning of period 334.4 Actual return on plan assets (43.4 Net purchases, sales and settlements 314.5 Balance at end of period 291.0 334.4 Asset Allocation The primary investment goal for our plans' assets is to maximize total asset returns while ensuring the plans' assets are available to fund the plans' liabilities as they become due. The plans' assets in aggregate and at the individual portfolio level are invested so that total portfolio risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best achieve this objective. The aggregate amount of our own stock held as investment for our domestic and foreign pension funds is considered negligible relative to the total fund assets. As of December 31, 2024, the weighted-average target and actual asset allocations relating to our domestic and foreign pension plans' assets are listed below. December 31, Asset Class 2025 Target Allocation Alternative investments Equity securities Fixed income securities Insurance contracts Liability driven investments Real estate & Other Total Alternative investments have the flexibility to dynamically invest across a broad range of asset classes including bonds, equity, cash, property and commodities. Liability driven investment strategies use government bonds as well as derivative instruments to hedge a portion of the impact of interest rates and inflation movements on the long-term liabilities. Cash Flows During 2024, we contributed $0.0 and $9.0 of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. For 2025, we expect to contribute approximately $0.0 and $9.0 of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. The estimated future benefit payments expected to be paid are presented below. Years Domestic Pension Plan Foreign Pension Plans Domestic Postretirement Benefit Plan 20302034 110.3 The estimated future payments for our domestic postretirement benefit plan are net of any estimated U.S. federal subsidies expected to be received under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which total no more than $0.2 in any individual year. Savings Plans sponsor defined contribution plans (the \"Savings Plans\") that cover substantially all domestic employees. The Savings Plans permit participants to make contributions on a pre-tax and/or after-tax basis and allow participants to choose among various investment alternatives. We match a portion of participant contributions based upon their years of service. Amounts expensed for the Savings Plans for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $67.6, $62.8 and $77.5, respectively. Expenses include a discretionary Company contribution of $0.0, $0.0 and $9.3 offset by participant forfeitures of $7.9, $5.8 and $6.3 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, we maintain defined contribution plans in various foreign countries and contributed $63.7, $62.5 and $58.2 to these plans in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Deferred Compensation and Benefit Arrangements We have deferred compensation and benefit arrangements which (i) permit certain of our key officers and employees to defer a portion of their salary or incentive compensation or (ii) require us to contribute an amount to the participant's account. These arrangements may provide participants with the amounts deferred plus interest upon attaining certain conditions, such as completing a certain number of years of service, attaining a certain age or upon retirement or termination. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the deferred compensation and deferred benefit liability balance was $105.4 and $126.5, respectively. Amounts expensed for deferred compensation and benefit arrangements in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $8.7, $10.7 and $2.1, respectively. We have purchased life insurance policies on participants' lives to assist in the funding of the related deferred compensation and deferred benefit liabilities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cash surrender value of these policies was $170.9 and $164.7, respectively. Long-Term Disability Plan We have a long-term disability plan which provides income replacement benefits to eligible participants who are unable to perform their job duties or any job related to his or her education, training or experience. As all income replacement benefits are fully insured, no related obligation is required as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. In addition to income replacement benefits, plan participants may remain covered for certain health and life insurance benefits up to normal retirement age, and accordingly, we have recorded an obligation of $7.3 and $5.3 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Note 16: Segment Information IPG's agency brands are grouped into reportable segments based on the agencies' primary capabilities. As of December 31, 2024, we have three reportable segments: MD&E, IA&C and SC&E. We also report results for the \"Corporate and other\" group. The MD&E segment provides, and is distinguished by innovative capabilities and scale in, global media and communications services, digital services and products, advertising and marketing technology, e-commerce services, data management and analytics, strategic consulting, and digital brand experience. MD&E is comprised of IPG Mediabrands, UM, Initiative, KINESSO, Acxiom and MRM. The IA&C segment provides advertising, corporate and brand identity services, and strategic consulting. IA&C is distinguished by the leading role of complex integrations of ideation and the execution of advertising and creative campaigns across all communications channels that are foundational to client brand identities. IA&C is comprised of leading global networks and agencies that provide a broad range of services, including McCann Worldgroup, IPG Health, MullenLowe Group, Foote, Cone & Belding (\"FCB\"), and our domestic integrated agencies. The SC&E segment provides best-in-class global public relations and other specialized communications services, events, sports and entertainment marketing, and strategic consulting. SC&E is comprised of agencies that provide a range of marketing services expertise, including Weber Shandwick, Golin, our sports, entertainment, and experiential agencies and IPG DXTRA Health. The Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") is the chief executive officer. The CODM evaluates each segments' operating performance based on segment EBITA, which is calculated as net income available to IPG common stockholders before provision for income taxes, total (expenses) and other income, equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, amortization of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill. Segment EBITA includes an allocation of a portion of centrally managed expenses described below. For all segments, the CODM uses segment EBITA in the annual budgeting and quarterly forecasting process and considers budget-to-actual current period to prior period variances to evaluate performance and make decisions regarding resource allocation for each segment. segments follow the same accounting policies as those described in Note 1. Corporate and other is primarily comprised of selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses includes corporate office expenses as well as shared service center and certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions; salaries, long-term incentives, annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees; professional fees related to internal control compliance, financial statement audits and legal, information technology and other consulting services that are engaged and managed through the corporate office; and rental expense for properties occupied by corporate office employees. A portion of centrally managed expenses is allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units. Amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technology-related projects, which are allocated based on utilization. Certain prior period amounts, wherever applicable, have been recast to reflect the transfer of certain agencies between our reportable segments. Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables.

Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies Guarantees We have guaranteed certain obligations of our subsidiaries relating principally to operating leases and uncommitted lines of credit of certain subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of parent company guarantees on lease obligations was $416.1 and $678.1, respectively, the amount of parent company guarantees primarily relating to uncommitted lines of credit was $256.6 and $255.7, respectively, and the amount of parent company guarantees related to daylight overdrafts, primarily utilized to manage intra-day overdrafts due to timing of transactions under cash pooling arrangements without resulting in incremental borrowings, was $79.6 and $85.5, respectively. In the event of non-payment by the applicable subsidiary of the obligations covered by a guarantee, we would be obligated to pay the amounts covered by that guarantee. As of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no material assets pledged as security for such parent company guarantees. Contingent Acquisition Obligations The following table details the estimated future contingent acquisition obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2024. Thereafter Total Deferred acquisition payments Redeemable non-controlling interests and call options with affiliates Total contingent acquisition payments We have entered into certain acquisitions that contain both redeemable non-controlling interests and call options with similar terms and conditions. The estimated amounts listed would be paid in the event of exercise at the earliest exercise date. We have certain redeemable non-controlling interests that are exercisable at the discretion of the non-controlling equity owners as of December 31, 2024. These estimated payments of $1.9 are included within the total payments expected to be made in 2025, and will continue to be carried forward into 2026 or beyond until exercised or expired. Redeemable non-controlling interests are included in the table at current exercise price payable in cash, not at applicable redemption value, in accordance with the authoritative guidance for classification and measurement of redeemable securities. The majority of these payments are contingent upon achieving projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject to revision in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements. See Note 7 for further information relating to the payment structure of our acquisitions. Legal Matters are involved in various legal proceedings, and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the normal course of business. The types of allegations that arise in connection with such legal proceedings vary in nature, but can include claims related to contract, employment, tax and intellectual property matters. We evaluate all cases each reporting period and record liabilities for losses from legal proceedings when we determine that it is probable that the outcome in a legal proceeding will be unfavorable and the amount, or potential range, of loss can be reasonably estimated. In certain cases, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages. While any outcome related to litigation or such governmental proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Note 18: Recent Accounting Standards Accounting pronouncements not listed below were assessed and determined to be not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance requiring additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and do not anticipate a material impact. Income Taxes In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring disaggregated information about an entity's effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as information on taxes paid. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Reporting In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance on segment reporting to improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analysis. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted the amended guidance for the year ended December 31, 2024, and applied the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For more detailed information about our reportable segments, see Note 16. Derivatives and Hedging In March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance on hedge accounting which allows nonprepayable financial assets to be included in a closed portfolio hedge using the portfolio layer method, allowing for more consistent accounting over prepayable and nonprepayable hedges. The new guidance also allows multiple hedged layers to be designated for a single closed portfolio, further aligning hedge accounting with risk management strategies. We adopted the standard January 1, 2023, which did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 19: Subsequent Events We announced on February 12, 2025 that our Board had declared a common stock cash dividend of $0.330 per share, payable on March 17, 2025 to holders of record as of the close of business on March 3, 2025. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, management began initiating restructuring actions designed to transform our business, enhance our offerings and drive significant structural expense savings. Management is currently evaluating the actions to be included in the plan, some of which will be non-cash, and are subject to change upon finalization. Actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2025.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score": 0.9993674159049988}, {"label": "positive", "score": 0.9980155229568481}, {"label":

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) (Unaudited) Note 1: Basis of Presentation The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company,\" \"IPG,\" \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\") in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") for reporting interim financial information on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include certain information and disclosures required for complete financial statements. The effects of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty have impacted and may continue to impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein reflect the latest estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods presented. The Company believes it has used reasonable estimates and assumptions to assess the fair values of goodwill, long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets; assessment of the annual effective tax rate; valuation of deferred income taxes and allowance for expected credit losses on future uncollectible accounts receivable. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and further decline in macroeconomic conditions or increasing interest rates could have a negative impact on these estimates, including the fair value of certain assets. The consolidated results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the \"2024 Annual Report\"). We conduct our business across three reportable segments described in Note 12. The three reportable segments are: Media, Data & Engagement Solutions (\"MD&E\"), Integrated Advertising & Creativity Led Solutions (\"IA&C\"), and Specialized Communications & Experiential Solutions (\"SC&E\"). Cost of services is comprised of the expenses of our revenue-producing reportable segments, including salaries and related expenses, office and other direct expenses and billable expenses, as well as an allocation of the centrally managed expenses from \"Corporate and Other\" group. Office and other direct expenses include rent expense, professional fees, certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and other costs directly attributable to client engagements. Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily the unallocated expenses from Corporate and Other, excluding depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of the fixed assets and intangible assets of the Company is disclosed as a separate operating expense. Restructuring charges in 2025 consist of actions designed to transform our business, enhance our offerings and drive significant structural expense savings. In the opinion of management, these unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the information for each period contained therein. Certain reclassifications and immaterial adjustments have been made to prior-period financial statements to conform to the current-period presentation, including the recast of certain prior-period amounts to reflect the transfer of agencies between reportable segments. Note 2: Planned Acquisition of IPG by Omnicom December 8, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Omnicom Group Inc. (\"Omnicom\") and EXT Subsidiary Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom (\"Merger Sub\"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into IPG, with IPG surviving the merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom. a result of the merger, each share of IPG common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than certain excluded shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.344 shares of Omnicom common stock and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares. The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock price changes prior to closing the merger. Following the close of the transaction, Omnicom shareholders will own 60.6% of the combined company and IPG shareholders will own 39.4%, on a fully diluted basis. As a result of the merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants. The stock-for-stock transaction is expected to be tax-free to IPG shareholders. On March 18, 2025, the shareholders of Omnicom and Interpublic each approved the acquisition of Interpublic at each company's special meeting of stockholders held that day. We have secured regulatory approvals for Omnicom's pending acquisition of IPG in all required jurisdictions other than the European Union (\"EU\"). We are continuing to pursue the required EU regulatory approval and expect that the acquisition will close by the end of November 2025. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including if Omnicom terminates the agreement as a result of a willful and material breach of our non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, then we will be obligated to pay a termination fee of $439.0 to Omnicom (the \"IPG Termination Fee\"). We will also be obligated to pay the IPG Termination Fee if we breach the Merger Agreement in a manner that Omnicom's closing conditions not being satisfied and the breach cannot be cured by the specified outside date and, in any such case, within 12 months after the termination date a competing proposal to acquire 50% or more of the business, assets or outstanding shares of IPG has been publicly announced and consummated, or a definitive agreement in respect of such competing proposal has been signed. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, $22.8 and $38.5, respectively, of deal costs were incurred related to the planned acquisition of IPG by Omnicom. Deal costs comprised of legal, professional, filing fees, and retention-related compensation expenses were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses, with the exception of $4.1 recorded within salaries, benefits, and related expenses for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. On August 11, 2025, in connection with the planned merger, Omnicom commenced an offer to exchange any and all of our outstanding 4.650% Senior Notes due 2028, 4.750% Senior Notes due 2030, 2.400% Senior Notes due 2031, 5.375% Senior Notes due 2033, 3.375% Senior Notes due 2041, and 5.400% Senior Notes due 2048 (collectively, the \"IPG Senior Notes\") for up to $2.95 billion in aggregate principal amount of new Omnicom notes and cash, and solicited consents to amend the indentures governing the IPG Senior Notes (the \"Proposed Amendments\"). On August 25, 2025, Omnicom and IPG announced that Omnicom has received sufficient consents to consummate the consent solicitations, and that IPG executed a supplemental indenture (the \"New IPG Supplemental Indenture\") to the existing IPG indentures related to the IPG Senior Notes in order to effect the Proposed Amendments. The Proposed Amendments will become operative upon the consummation of the exchange offers, which are currently set to expire on November 28, 2025, subject to further extension, and which are subject to the closing of the merger and certain other conditions. Note 3: Revenue Disaggregation of Revenue We have three reportable segments as of September 30, 2025: MD&E, IA&C and SC&E, as further discussed in Note 12.

Contract liabilities relate to advance consideration received from customers under the terms of our contracts primarily related to reimbursements of third-party expenses, whether we act as principal or agent, and to a lesser extent, periodic retainer fees, both of which are generally recognized shortly after billing. The majority of our contracts are for periods of one year or less with the exception of our data management contracts. For those contracts with a term of more than one year, we had approximately $517.4 of unsatisfied performance obligations as of September 30, 2025, which will be recognized as services are performed over the remaining contractual terms through 2030. Note 4: Debt and Credit Arrangements Long-Term Debt A summary of the carrying amounts of our long-term debt is listed below. Effective Interest September 30, December 31, 4.650% Senior Notes due 2028 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $0.6 and $1.3, respectively) 4.780 498.1 497.6 4.750% Senior Notes due 2030 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $1.9 and $2.8, respectively) 4.920 645.3 644.6 2.400% Senior Notes due 2031 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $0.5 and $2.5, respectively) 2.512 497.0 496.6 5.375% Senior Notes due 2033 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $3.1 and $2.5, respectively) 5.650 294.5 294.0 3.375% Senior Notes due 2041 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $0.9 and $4.5, respectively) 3.448 494.6 494.4 5.400% Senior Notes due 2048 (less unamortized discount and issuance costs of $2.5 and $4.3, respectively) 5.480 493.2 493.1 Other notes payable and finance leases Total long-term debt 2,923.1 2,920.6 Less: current portion Long-term debt, excluding current portion 2,923.0 2,920.5 As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt was $2,751.9 and $2,702.0, respectively. Refer to Note 13 for details. Credit Agreement We maintain a committed corporate credit facility, originally dated as of July 18, 2008, which has been amended and restated from time to time (the \"Credit Agreement\"). We use our Credit Agreement to increase our financial flexibility, to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries and to support our commercial paper program. On May 29, 2024, we amended and restated the Credit Agreement. As amended, among other things, the maturity date of the Credit Agreement was extended to May 29, 2029, and the cost structure of the Credit Agreement was changed. The Credit Agreement continues to include a required leverage ratio of not more than 3.50 to 1.00, among other customary covenants, including limitations on our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary debt. At the election of the Company, the leverage ratio may be changed to not more than 4.00 to 1.00 for four consecutive quarters, beginning with the fiscal quarter in which there is an occurrence of one or more acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of at least $200.0. The Credit Agreement is a revolving facility, under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the Credit Agreement may be repaid and reborrowed, subject to an aggregate lending limit of $1,500.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. The Company has the ability to increase the commitments under the Credit Agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to $250.0, provided the Company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions. The aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase, subject to a sublimit of $50.0, or the equivalent in other currencies. Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured. As of September 30, 2025, there were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement; however, we had $9.1 of letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, which reduced our total availability to $1,490.9. We were in compliance with all of our covenants in the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2025. Uncommitted Lines of Credit We also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates and that are primarily used to fund working capital needs. We have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries. If we lose access to these credit lines, we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations. As of September 30, 2025, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit in an aggregate amount of $676.7, under which we had outstanding borrowings of $56.8 classified as short-term borrowings on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The average amount outstanding during the third quarter of 2025 was $40.2 with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 7.4%. Commercial Paper The Company is authorized to issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1,500.0. Borrowings under the program are supported by the Credit Agreement described above. Proceeds of the commercial paper are used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness and other short-term liquidity needs. The maturities of the commercial paper vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. During the third quarter of 2025, there was no commercial paper activity and, as of September 30, 2025, there was no commercial paper outstanding.

Other - During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the amounts recognized were primarily related to pension and post-retirement costs, which were partially offset by changes in the fair market value of equity investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Share Repurchase Programs February 11, 2025, the Board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to $155.0, excluding fees, of our common stock. We may effect such repurchases through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") rules, derivative transactions or other means. The timing and amount of repurchases in future periods will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements. The following table presents our share repurchase activity under our share repurchase programs for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024. Nine months ended September 30, Number of shares repurchased Aggregate cost, including fees 257.4 230.1 Average price per share, including fees 25.39 31.40 The amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 excludes $2.1 and $1.9 of estimated excise tax on net share repurchases, respectively. As of September 30, 2025, $68.1, excluding fees, remains available for repurchase under the 2025 share repurchase program. There is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase program. Redeemable Non-controlling Interests Many of our acquisitions include provisions under which the non-controlling equity owners may require us to purchase additional interests in a subsidiary at their discretion. Redeemable non-controlling interests are adjusted quarterly, if necessary, to their estimated redemption value, but not less than their initial fair value. Any adjustments to the redemption value impact retained earnings or additional paid in capital, except for foreign currency translation adjustments. The following table presents changes in our redeemable non-controlling interests. Nine months ended September 30, Balance at beginning of period Change in related non-controlling interests balance Changes in redemption value of redeemable non-controlling interests: Additions Redemptions and other (15.6 Redemption value adjustments (20.2 Currency translation adjustments Balance at end of period Held for Sale Long-lived assets (disposal groups) to be sold are classified as held for sale in the period which all criteria are met. The Company measures assets (disposal group) held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. During the third quarter of 2025, management determined that the assets and liabilities of an agency within our SC&E segment, met the criteria to be presented as held for sale. The planned disposal is expected to be completed within twelve months of designation and does not constitute a strategic shift of the Company's operations and therefore does not meet the discontinued operations criteria. Any differences due to changes in fair values less costs to sell or carrying values for disposal groups will be recognized as a gain or loss in future financial statements. See further discussion below in the \"Goodwill\" section within Note 6. The following table sets provides a reconciliation of the carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale, respectively, to the amounts presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2025. September 30, 2025 ASSETS: Cash and cash equivalents Accounts receivable Accounts receivable, billable to clients Other current assets Goodwill and other intangibles Deferred income taxes Other non-current assets TOTAL ASSETS HELD FOR SALE 196.0 LIABILITIES: Accounts payable 117.0 Accrued liabilities Other current Liabilities Other non-current liabilities TOTAL LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE 121.3 NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Goodwill Goodwill is the excess purchase price remaining from an acquisition after an allocation of purchase price has been made to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. During the third quarter of 2025, an agency that comprised a significant portion of a reporting unit within our SC&E segment was classified as held for sale. Additionally, the Company transferred certain agencies between operating segments as of January 1, 2025, April 1, 2025 and September 1, 2025. The agency transfers that occurred as of April 1, 2025 resulted in certain changes to our reporting units and reportable segments. We have allocated goodwill to our reporting units, including the remaining reporting unit subsequent to the held for sale classification, using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all impacted reporting units immediately prior and subsequent to the reallocations, and held for sale classification, and determined that no impairment existed. The following table sets forth details of changes in goodwill by reportable segment of the Company: Total Balance at December 31, 2024 2,332.8 1,681.8 674.8 4,689.4 Goodwill Reallocation Acquisitions/(Dispositions) (45.0 Foreign currency and other Balance at September 30, 2025 2,398.4 1,714.7 637.3 4,750.4 The goodwill balances at December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025 include $207.2 of accumulated impairment within the MD&E reportable segment. The amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 within our MD&E segment is due to the acquisition of an e-commerce, intelligence platform, for which we paid $54.2, net of cash acquired. The amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 within our SC&E segment represents goodwill allocated to a business which is held for sale. Note 7: Income Taxes For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, our income tax rate was negatively impacted by losses related to the disposition of previously held for sale entities for which we recorded a nominal tax benefit and by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100% valuation allowances. This was partially offset by the release of previously recorded reserves for tax contingencies. On July 4, 2025, the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" (OBBBA) was signed into law in the U.S., which contains a broad range of significant tax reform provisions. The Company is currently evaluating the full effects of these legislative changes and does not anticipate a material impact. We have various tax years under examination by tax authorities in the U.S., in various countries, and in various states and localities, such as New York City, in which we have significant business operations. It is not yet known whether these examinations will, in the aggregate, result in our paying additional taxes. We believe our tax reserves are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and, if necessary, adjust our reserves as additional information or events require. With respect to all tax years open to examination by U.S. federal, various state and local, and non-U.S. authorities, we currently anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by an amount between $90.0 and $100.0 in the next twelve months, a portion of which will affect our effective income tax rate, primarily as a result of the settlement of tax examinations and the lapsing of statutes of limitations. This net decrease is related to various items of income and expense, primarily transfer pricing adjustments. We are effectively settled with respect to U.S. federal income tax audits through 2020. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local income tax audits for years prior to 2015 or non-U.S. income tax audits for years prior to 2011. Note 8: Restructuring Charges Restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 consist of new actions taken in the first nine months of 2025. Restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 represent adjustments to the 2022 Real Estate Actions, as well as adjustments to the actions taken in 2020. The components of restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are listed below. Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, Severance and termination costs 177.7 Lease impairment costs 108.0 Other related costs 165.1 Total restructuring charges 129.5 450.8 2025 Restructuring Actions In the first quarter of 2025, management initiated restructuring actions, as previously disclosed, which are designed to transform our business, enhance our offerings and drive significant structural expense savings. Management currently expects the total charges in connection with these actions to be approximately $450.0 - $475.0, a portion being non-cash, which is subject to change upon finalization of the actions. Actions are expected to be completed by the end of 2025. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, severance and termination costs related to a planned reduction in workforce of approximately 800 employees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, severance and termination costs related to a planned reduction in workforce of approximately 3,200 employees. The employee groups affected include executive, regional and account management as well as administrative, creative and media production personnel. Lease impairment costs, which relate to the office spaces that were vacated as part of the 2025 restructuring actions and reduced our occupied global real estate footprint by approximately 135,000 and 730,000 square feet for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, included impairments of operating lease right-of-use assets. Lease impairments were calculated based on estimated fair values using market participant assumptions including forecasted net discounted cash flows related to the operating lease right-of-use assets. Other related costs primarily include leasehold improvements and furniture and asset retirement obligations associated with office spaces vacated as part of the 2025 restructuring actions, third-party costs to assist in identifying areas of structural expense savings in relation to our restructuring initiatives, write-offs of unutilized assets, and losses on sales of equity and debt investments. Leasehold improvements and furniture and asset retirement obligations were estimated using market participant assumptions including forecasted net discounted cash flows. A summary of the restructuring activities related to the 2025 restructuring actions is as follows: 2025 Restructuring Actions Restructuring Expense Non-Cash Items Payments Liability at September 30, Severance and termination costs 177.7 122.0 Lease impairment costs 108.0 107.8 Other related costs 165.1 Total 450.8 179.8 196.1 2022 Real Estate Actions & 2020 Restructuring Plan There were no adjustments to the 2020 Plan and 2022 Real Estate Actions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. Net restructuring charges of $0.5 and $1.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively were related to adjustments to our restructuring actions taken in 2020 and 2022. Note 9: Incentive Compensation Plans We issue stock-based compensation and cash awards to our employees under various plans established by the Compensation and Leadership Talent Committee of the Board of Directors (the \"Compensation Committee\") and approved by our stockholders. We issued the following stock-based awards under the 2019 Performance Incentive Plan (the \"2019 PIP\") during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. Awards Weighted-average grant-date fair value (per award) Restricted stock (units) 27.07 Performance-based stock (shares) 23.64 Cash-settled awards 27.19 Total stock-based compensation awards During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Compensation Committee granted performance cash awards under the 2019 PIP and restricted cash awards under the 2020 Restricted Cash Plan with a total annual target value of $1.3 and $8.7, respectively. Cash awards are expensed over the vesting period, which is typically three years for performance cash awards and two years or three years for restricted cash awards. Note 10: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, Net of Tax The following tables present the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, by component. Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Derivative Instruments Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Total Balance as of December 31, 2024 (940.8 (202.5 (1,112.6 Other comprehensive income before reclassifications 189.2 189.2 Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax Balance as of September 30, 2025 (731.3 (191.1 (893.9 Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments Derivative Instruments Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans Total Balance as of December 31, 2023 (789.1 (190.6 (946.2 Other comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax Balance as of September 30, 2024 (791.7 (185.8 (946.1 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 are as follows: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, Affected Line Item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations Foreign currency translation adjustments Other expense, net Net gain on derivative instruments Other expense, net, Interest expense Amortization of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan items Other expense, net Tax effect Provision for income taxes Total amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax Note 11: Employee Benefits We have a defined benefit pension plan that covers certain U.S. employees (the \"Domestic Pension Plan\"). We also have numerous funded and unfunded plans outside the U.S. The Interpublic Limited Pension Plan in the U.K. (the \"U.K. Pension Plan\") is a defined benefit plan and is our most material foreign pension plan in terms of the benefit obligation and plan assets. Some of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries provide postretirement health benefits and life insurance to eligible employees and, in certain cases, their dependents. The domestic postretirement benefit plan is our most material postretirement benefit plan in terms of the benefit obligation. Certain immaterial foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans have been excluded from the table below. In December 2023, the U.K. Pension Plan entered into an agreement with an insurance company to purchase a group annuity, or \"buy-in\", that matches the plan's future projected benefit obligations to covered participants. As part of the annuity purchase contract, the U.K. Pension Plan has the option to complete a \"buy-out\", which would transfer all liabilities of the plan to the insurer, which the Company anticipates to be completed in 2026. The non-cash settlement charge, net of tax, associated with the transaction is currently estimated to be approximately $180.0 to $200.0 and is subject to finalization of terms and changes in the British Pound Sterling. In June 2025, participants of our Domestic Pension Plan were provided the option to request lump sum distributions, which resulted in a partial settlement of the plan. The lump sum election window ended August 4, 2025. A non-cash settlement charge, net of tax, of $6.5 was incurred in the third quarter of 2025. The Company also expects to make an incremental contribution to the plan in the fourth quarter of 2025 of approximately $16.0. The components of net periodic cost for the Domestic Pension Plan, the significant foreign pension plans and the domestic postretirement benefit plan are listed below. Domestic Pension Foreign Pension Plans Domestic Postretirement Benefit Plan Three Months Ended September 30, Service cost Interest cost Expected return on plan assets Settlements Amortization of: Prior service cost Unrecognized actuarial losses Net periodic cost Domestic Pension Foreign Pension Plans Domestic Postretirement Benefit Plan Nine Months Ended September 30, Service cost Interest cost Expected return on plan assets (12.9 (11.1 Settlements Amortization of: Prior service cost Unrecognized actuarial losses Net periodic cost The components of net periodic cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item \"Other expense, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we contributed $0.0 and $7.4 of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. For the remainder of 2025, we expect to contribute approximately $16.0 and $2.0 of cash to our domestic and foreign pension plans, respectively. Note 12: Segment Information IPG's agency brands are grouped into reportable segments based on the agencies' primary capabilities. As of September 30, 2025, we have three reportable segments: MD&E, IA&C, and SC&E. We also report results for the \"Corporate and other\" group. MD&E primarily provides, and is distinguished by innovative capabilities and scale in, global media and communications services, digital services and products, advertising and marketing technology, e-commerce services, data management and analytics, strategic consulting, and digital brand experience. MD&E is comprised of IPG Mediabrands, UM, Initiative, KINESSO, Acxiom and MRM. IA&C primarily provides advertising, corporate and brand identity services, and strategic consulting. IA&C is distinguished by the leading role of complex integrations of ideation and the execution of advertising and creative campaigns across all communications channels that are foundational to client brand identities. IA&C is comprised of leading global networks and agencies that provide a broad range of services, including McCann Worldgroup, IPG Health, MullenLowe Group, Foote, Cone & Belding (\"FCB\"), and our domestic integrated agencies. SC&E primarily provides best-in-class global public relations and other specialized communications services, events, sports and entertainment marketing, and strategic consulting. SC&E is comprised of agencies that provide a range of marketing services expertise, including Weber Shandwick, Golin, our sports, entertainment, and experiential agencies, and IPG DXTRA Health. Certain prior period amounts, wherever applicable, have been recast to reflect the transfer of certain agencies between reportable segments. We continue to evaluate our financial reporting structure, and the profitability measure employed by our chief operating decision maker for allocating resources to operating divisions and assessing operating division performance is segment EBITA. Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following table.

Note 13: Fair Value Measurements Authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Financial Instruments that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We primarily apply the market approach to determine the fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no changes to our valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of financial instruments during the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The following tables present information about our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. September 30, 2025 Balance Sheet Classification Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Cash equivalents 721.5 721.5 Cash and cash equivalents Liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations Accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities December 31, 2024 Balance Sheet Classification Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Cash equivalents 1,139.5 1,139.5 Cash and cash equivalents Liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations Accrued liabilities and Other non-current liabilities Contingent acquisition obligations includes deferred acquisition payments and unconditional obligations to purchase additional non-controlling equity shares of consolidated subsidiaries. Fair value measurement of the obligations is based upon actual and projected operating performance targets as specified in the related agreements. The decrease in this balance of $(5.2) from December 31, 2024 to September 30, 2025 is primarily due to payments related to our deferred acquisitions payments from prior-year acquisitions. The amounts payable within the next twelve months are classified in accrued liabilities; any amounts payable thereafter are classified in other non-current liabilities. Financial Instruments that are not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table presents information about our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value. September 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total long-term debt 2,751.6 2,751.9 2,701.6 2,702.0 Our long-term debt is comprised of senior notes and other notes payable. The fair value of our senior notes, which are traded over-the-counter, is based on quoted prices in markets that are not active. Therefore, these senior notes are classified as Level 2. Our other notes payable are not actively traded, and their fair value is not solely derived from readily observable inputs. The fair value of our other notes payable is determined based on a discounted cash flow model and other proprietary valuation methods, and therefore is classified as Level 3. See Note 4 for further information on our long-term debt. The discount rates used as significant unobservable inputs in the Level 3 fair value measurements of our contingent acquisition obligations and long-term debt as of September 30, 2025 ranged from 4.0% to 6.0%. Non-financial Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Certain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, primarily goodwill (Level 3), intangible assets, and property and equipment. Accordingly, these assets are not measured and adjusted to fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to periodic evaluations for potential impairment. Note 14: Commitments and Contingencies Guarantees As discussed in our 2024 Annual Report, we have guaranteed certain obligations of our subsidiaries relating principally to operating leases and uncommitted lines of credit of certain subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the amount of parent company guarantees on lease obligations was $364.7 and $416.1, respectively, the amount of parent company guarantees primarily relating to uncommitted lines of credit was $245.7 and $256.6, respectively, and the amount of parent company guarantees related to daylight overdrafts, primarily utilized to manage intra-day overdrafts due to timing of transactions under cash pooling arrangements without resulting in incremental borrowings, was $86.4 and $79.6, respectively. In the event of non-payment by the applicable subsidiary of the obligations covered by a guarantee, we would be obligated to pay the amounts covered by that guarantee. As of both September 30, 2025, and December 31, 2024 there were no material assets pledged as security for such parent company guarantees. Legal Matters We are involved in various legal proceedings, and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the normal course of business. The types of allegations that arise in connection with such legal proceedings vary in nature, but can include claims related to contract, employment, tax and intellectual property matters. We evaluate all cases each reporting period and record liabilities for losses from legal proceedings when we determine that it is probable that the outcome in a legal proceeding will be unfavorable and the amount, or potential range, of loss can be reasonably estimated. In certain cases, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages. While any outcome related to litigation or such governmental proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Note 15: Recent Accounting Standards Accounting pronouncements not listed below were assessed and determined to be not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. IntangiblesGoodwill and Other In September 2025, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance to increase the operability of the recognition guidance considering different methods of software development. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2027 and interim periods within those annual reporting periods. We are currently evaluating the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and do not anticipate a material impact. Income StatementReporting Comprehensive Income In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance requiring additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and do not anticipate a material impact. Income Taxes In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring disaggregated information about an entity's effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as information on taxes paid. This amended guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We do not anticipate that the expanded disclosure requirements will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.", "individual_sentiments": [{"label": "neutral", "score":

INFORMATION AS AT AND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2025, AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 Exhibit 99.1 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On December 8, 2024, Omnicom Group Inc. (\"Omnicom\") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\"), by and among Omnicom, EXT Subsidiary Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom (\"Merger Sub\"), and The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (\"IPG\"), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into IPG (the \"Merger\"), with IPG surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom. Each share of IPG common stock will be converted into, and represent the right to receive, 0.344 shares of common stock of Omnicom, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Omnicom common stock that otherwise would have been issued. On March 18, 2025, the shareholders of each of Omnicom and IPG approved the Merger. The completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals. We have secured regulatory approvals for Omnicom's pending acquisition of IPG in all required jurisdictions and expect to close the Merger by the close of business on November 26, 2025. The Merger is not subject to a financing condition or the completion of the Exchange Offers or Consent Solicitations announced by Omnicom and IPG on August 11, 2025 related to IPG's outstanding senior notes (the \"Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations\"). Omnicom has received sufficient tenders and consents to consummate the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, which are currently set to expire on November 28, 2025. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared from the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Omnicom and IPG and reflect transaction accounting adjustments related to the Merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 are presented as if the Merger had been completed on January 1, 2024. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2025 is presented as if the Merger had been completed on September 30, 2025. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been developed from and should be read in conjunction with: the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Omnicom included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2025; the unaudited consolidated financial statements of IPG included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2025; the audited consolidated financial statements of Omnicom included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024; the audited consolidated financial statements of IPG included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024; and other information relating to Omnicom and IPG contained in reports filed by Omnicom or IPG, as applicable, with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared to reflect adjustments to Omnicom's historical consolidated financial information representing Omnicom management's estimates based on information available as of November 26, 2025 and are subject to change as additional information becomes available and analyses are performed. However, Omnicom management believes that the assumptions provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects of the Merger as contemplated, and that the pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions and are properly applied in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect the following adjustments, which include transaction accounting adjustments: the reclassification of certain items within IPG's historical presentation to conform to Omnicom's financial statement presentation; the Merger, using the acquisition method of accounting, with Omnicom as the accounting acquirer and each share of IPG common stock converted into 0.344 shares of Omnicom common stock; and estimated purchase accounting adjustments and related impacts on the balance sheet and income statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Omnicom has been treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes, primarily due to Omnicom stockholders holding majority voting interests in the combined company, Omnicom issuing equity interests to effect the Merger and the management of Omnicom continuing to manage the combined entity. Thus, Omnicom will account for the Merger as a business combination in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations The total purchase price will be allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their respective fair values. The fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of IPG have been measured based on various preliminary estimates using assumptions that Omnicom management believes are reasonable and based on currently available information. Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The final purchase accounting could be materially different from the preliminary estimates used to prepare the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements which could have a material impact on the combined company's future results of operations and financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based on the aforementioned historical financial statements and the assumptions and adjustments as described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The pro forma adjustments reflect transaction accounting adjustments related to the Merger, which are discussed in further detail below. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent the combined company's consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position that would actually have occurred had the Merger been consummated on the dates assumed or to project the combined company's consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position for any future date or period. The accounting policies followed in preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are those used by Omnicom as set forth in Omnicom's audited historical financial statements. Based on Omnicom's initial review and understanding of IPG's summary of significant accounting policies included in IPG's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, management is not aware of any material differences to conform IPG's historical financial information to Omnicom's significant accounting policies. A more comprehensive comparison and assessment will occur, which may result in additional differences identified. Additionally, Omnicom has included certain reclassifications for consistency in the financial statement presentation, including with respect to certain IPG restructuring charges. These reclassifications have no effect on the previously reported total assets, total liabilities and shareholders' equity, or net income of Omnicom or IPG. See Notes 2 and 3 in the Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements for more information. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the costs of any post close integration activities, severance, or impairments, or any cost savings or synergies that may be achieved because of the Merger or costs to achieve the synergies. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not give effect to the estimated impacts of the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations. IPG and Omnicom have not had any historical material relationship prior to the Merger. Accordingly, no pro forma adjustments were required to eliminate activities between the companies.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Description of the Merger and Basis of Pro Forma Presentation On December 8, 2024, Omnicom Group Inc. (\"Omnicom\") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\"), by and among Omnicom, EXT Subsidiary Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom (\"Merger Sub\"), and The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (\"IPG\"), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into IPG (the \"Merger\"), with IPG surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom. Each share of IPG common stock will be converted into, and represent the right to receive, 0.344 shares of common stock of Omnicom, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Omnicom common stock that otherwise would have been issued. On March 18, 2025, the shareholders of each of Omnicom and IPG approved the Merger. The completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals. We have secured regulatory approvals for Omnicom's pending acquisition of IPG in all required jurisdictions and expect to close the Merger by the close of business on November 26, 2025. The Merger is not subject to a financing condition or the completion of the Exchange Offers or Consent Solicitations announced by Omnicom and IPG on August 11, 2025 related to IPG's outstanding senior notes (the \"Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations\"). Omnicom has received sufficient tenders and consents to consummate the Exchange Offers and Consent Solicitations, which are currently set to expire on November 28, 2025. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared from the respective historical consolidated financial statements of Omnicom and IPG and reflect transaction accounting adjustments related to the Merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 have been presented as if the Merger had been completed on January 1, 2024. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2025 has been presented as if the Merger had occurred on September 30, 2025. Certain balance sheet and statements of income reclassifications have been made to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in order to align historical presentation between Omnicom and IPG. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for a discussion of these reclassification adjustments. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, and Omnicom is considered the accounting acquirer. The acquisition method of accounting, based on ASC 805, uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\"ASC 820\"). Fair value is defined in ASC 820 as the \"price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\" This is an exit price concept for the valuation of an asset or liability. Market participants are assumed to be buyers or sellers in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Fair value measurement for an asset assumes the highest and best use by these market participants, and as a result, assets may be required to be recorded which are not intended to be used or sold and/or at a fair value measurement that does not reflect management's intended use for those assets. Fair value measurements can be highly subjective, and it is possible the application of reasonable judgment could develop different assumptions resulting in a range of alternative estimates using the same facts and circumstances. ASC 805 requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at fair value as of the Merger date, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. As of November 26, 2025, the accompanying unaudited estimated purchase price allocation is preliminary and is subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. The potential changes to the purchase price allocation and related pro forma adjustments could be material. For the purposes of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, Omnicom's management has conducted a preliminary analysis of the adjustments required to conform IPG's financial statements to reflect the current accounting policies of Omnicom. This assessment is ongoing, and, at the time of preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, management is not aware of any material accounting policy differences. Upon consummation of the Merger, Omnicom management will conduct a final review of IPG's accounting policies to determine if differences in accounting policies or financial statement classification exist that may require adjustments to or reclassification of IPG's results of operations, assets or liabilities to conform to Omnicom's accounting policies and classifications. As a result of that review, differences may be identified that, when conformed, could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Summary of Reclassification Adjustments Balance Sheet The classification of certain balance sheet items presented by IPG under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") has been adjusted to align with the presentation used by Omnicom under GAAP, as shown below.

Omnicom share price is as of the close of business November 19, 2025. The actual value of the shares of Omnicom common stock to be issued in the Merger will depend on the market price of shares of Omnicom common stock at the closing date of the Merger, and therefore the actual consideration will fluctuate based on the market price of the shares of Omnicom common stock. Accordingly, the final consideration could differ significantly from the current estimate. A 10% increase or decrease in Omnicom's share price would increase or decrease the consideration by approximately $895.4 million and impact goodwill by a corresponding amount. Represents the historical share-based awards that will be replaced and cash settled by Omnicom. Refer to (i) in Note 5 below (Pro forma adjustments). Consideration paid for fractional shares is immaterial. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total consideration is allocated to IPG's assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of completion of the Merger. Based upon the estimated purchase price and a preliminary valuation, the preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows: Preliminary purchase price allocation As of September 30, Cash and cash equivalents 1,531.2 Accounts receivable 4,946.4 Work in process 2,073.6 Assets held for sale 196.0 Other current assets 664.1 Property and Equipment 319.2 Operating lease right-of-use assets 831.1 Equity method investments Goodwill 7,356.1 Intangible assets 4,105.7 Other assets 786.6 Total assets 22,849.2 Accounts payable 7,108.5 Customer advances 595.7 Current portion of debt Short-term debt Liabilities held for sale 121.3 Other current liabilities 875.1 Long-term liabilities 495.4 Long-term liability - operating leases 919.0 Long-term debt 2,751.9 Deferred tax liabilities 803.6 Non-controlling interests Redeemable noncontrolling interests Total liabilities and noncontrolling interests 13,782.6 Total Consideration 9,066.6 The purchase price estimates and the purchase price allocation are preliminary and are subject to change based on the Omnicom share price at the closing date of the Merger, as well as the actual net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities that exist on the closing date of the Merger, and the value of certain tax contingencies. The purchase price allocation related to certain tangible and intangible assets and liabilities is ongoing. This includes, but is not limited to, items such as property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, and redeemable noncontrolling interests. The final determination of the purchase price allocation will be completed as soon as practicable after the completion of the Merger and will be based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The final amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed could differ significantly from the amounts presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on how the consideration and purchase price allocation have been reflected in the pro forma adjustments. Forma Adjustments The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflects the following adjustments. Acquisition of all outstanding shares of IPG common stock. As of September 30, Shares of Omnicom issued to IPG stockholders (Common stock) Shares of Omnicom issued to IPG stockholders (Additional paid-in capital) 8,934.9 Total equity consideration 8,953.6 Purchase price allocation (the amounts below represent changes; refer to Note 4 for preliminary fair value estimates). The adjustments as a result of the purchase price allocation include the recognition of new intangible assets, net of the removal of historical intangible assets, the recognition of new goodwill, net of the removal of historical goodwill, adjustment to the fair value of the debt, and adjustment to the fair value of deferred taxes to reflect the after tax basis difference of the intangible assets. As of September 30, Adjustments to: Intangible assets 3,307.2 Goodwill 2,605.7 (171.1 Deferred income taxes 566.1 The identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of trade names, customer relationships and technology with estimated fair values of $973.0 million, $2,886.0 million and $246.7 million, respectively. Trade names, customer relationships and technology are amortized straight-line over estimated remaining useful lives of 15 years, 10 years and 5 years, respectively. The fair values for intangible assets were estimated using a market participant approach. The fair values for trade names were estimated by applying the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. The fair values for customer relationships were estimated using the profit contribution method under the income approach. The current estimate of fair values for the technology intangible assets were estimated based on the historical book value of the similar assets. The final purchase price allocation for intangible assets could materially differ from the estimates. A ten percent increase in the value of the acquired intangible assets would increase the intangible assets by $410.6 million and result in a corresponding increase to amortization expense of $77.0 million. Deferred income taxes were adjusted to include deferred tax liabilities related to the identified intangible assets that will be amortized. In addition, estimates were made to deferred taxes related to net operating losses that may not be utilized and withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that may be required in certain jurisdictions of the combined entities (see (f) below). Reflects adjustments to equity related to: eliminate IPG historical equity of $3,656.8 million; and give effect to the transaction costs adjustment of $140.0 million described in (d) to retained earnings. As of September 30, 2025 Common stock (37.4 Additional paid-in capital (478.1 Retained earnings (4,434.7 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 893.9 Treasury stock, at cost 259.5 Total (3,796.8 Represents the accrual of direct and incremental transaction costs expected to be incurred after September 30, 2025, in connection with the closing of the Merger, which are non-recurring. The estimate is based on Omnicom management's judgment after evaluating several factors, including evaluating its most recent overall expected budget for transaction costs and amounts contractually due to external advisors and service providers. These costs will not affect Omnicom's income statement beyond 12 months after the acquisition date and costs related to future integration activities are not included in this estimate. The historical income statements of Omnicom include acquisition related costs of $175.4 million ($14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and $160.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025). Year Ended December 31, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Acquisition-related costs 140.0 Incremental amortization resulting from the preliminary allocation of purchase price. Year Ended December 31, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Incremental amortization 284.3 209.3 Adjusts the deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets as a result of the Merger. An increase to deferred tax liabilities was recorded as part of the allocation of purchase price in adjustment (b) above. The income tax effects related to the increase of the acquiree's net operating loss valuation allowance and the taxes recognized on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are also presented as adjustments to purchase accounting. As of September 30, 2025 Incremental valuation allowance (29.0 Incremental withholding tax accruals Adjusts the common shares outstanding to reflect the Omnicom common stock that will be issued as stock consideration and the removal of IPG's shares.

This reflects the awards that are unvested at the Merger closing date and assumes no grant will be made after the Merger closing date. The share-based awards of IPG will be replaced with cash-based awards as of the closing date and have been reflected at the estimated replacement award for such share-based awards using the estimated IPG share price at closing. The expense for any awards with a remaining service period after the closing date has been included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. IPG cash-based and share-based awards include a change of control provision that requires payment upon both a change of control event and subsequent termination (double trigger). Adjustments have been made for certain awards that had a double trigger which accelerated the vesting. Where no determination has been made in relation to the double trigger and whether both criteria requiring payment upon a change in control would be satisfied, no acceleration has been made. adjustment below reflects the impact to selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") for those employees whose compensation expense was included within SG&A and Salary and related for those employees included within Salary and related. The following reflects the previously recorded income statement impacts and the adjusted income statement impacts for each period presented. Year Ended December 31, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Previously recognized IPG incentive compensation plan expense 101.0 Pro forma adjustment to SG&A Pro forma adjustment to Salary and related expenses (23.3 Incentive compensation plan expense included above 121.0 Reflects the accrual for share-based awards that will all be cash settled after completion of the Merger. The amount represents the portion of the service period that has been completed as of the Merger closing date. As of September 30, 2025 Accrual for incentive compensation plans - current liability Accrual for incentive compensation plans - long-term liability Reflects the increase in interest expense for the fair value adjustment of the debt.

(\"GLS\"), pursuant to the terms of the reinsurance contract, demanded and is currently engaged in an arbitration with one of its ceding companies. Under the subject reinsurance agreement, GLS provides the ceding company in question with (i) reinsurance premium protection (\"RPP\") coverage with aggregate limits of approximately $25.0 million, and (ii) adverse development coverage (\"ADC\") with remaining aggregate limits of $25.5 million. GLS is asserting that the cedant has committed multiple breaches of the reinsurance agreement, along with other material misrepresentations. Based on these assertions, GLS is seeking full rescission of the reinsurance agreement and related relief, including the ability to recoup losses previously paid, and has denied payment of certain invoices for contractual performance pending the outcome of this arbitration. GLS has previously paid net losses of $10.8 million related to the RPP coverage. GLS has not paid any losses subject to the ADC coverage of the reinsurance agreement in question. As of September 30, 2025, GLS has liabilities of $4.0 million subject to the RPP coverage and $7.5 million in reserves for the ADC coverage. GLS received premiums totaling $9.7 million and $9.8 million for the RPP and ADC coverages, respectively. GLS is vigorously pursuing its claims for rescission and recovery of amounts previously paid. The matter is currently proceeding in arbitration, and an arbitration hearing has now been completed with a decision likely in the first quarter of 2026. The cedant disputes GLS assertions, denying that it breached the agreement, and seeks to continue the contract in full force. The outcome of the arbitration is inherently uncertain. If GLS is successful, it may be entitled to recover up to $10.0 million in losses previously paid and may be relieved of its remaining obligations under the reinsurance agreement in addition to other requested relief. If GLS is unsuccessful, GLS may be required to continue performing under the contract, including potentially paying additional amounts under the RPP coverage, subject to a cap, and being liable for additional amounts under the ADC coverage. The Company's subsidiary Maiden Reinsurance Ltd. has provided a parental guarantee to guarantee the performance and obligations of GLS as finally determined in connection with the arbitration. At this time, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or range of any gain or loss that may result from this matter. Accordingly, no accrual or gain contingency has been recorded in the Company's reserves and other liabilities. An adverse outcome could be material to the Company's results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. 2 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
